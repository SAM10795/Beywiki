Team Star Breaker Set - Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization Team Star Breaker Set From Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization Team Star Breaker Set Number: BB-95, BB-99, BB-100 System: Metal Fight Beyblade Contents 1 Contents 2 Overall 3 Gallery Note: This Set's release is exclusive to Hasbro. Contents Killer Beafowl UW145EWD (Evil Befall UW145EWD) Hell Kerbecs BD145DS (Hades Kerbecs BD145DS) Flame Byxis 230WD Two Ripcord Launchers Overall An abundance of useful parts can be obtained through this Set. Although UW145 is not particularly effective, BD145 is the go-to Track for Defense purposes and it works well in conjuction with EDS for Stamina types, while 230 is top-tier in Stamina and Balance. Flame and Killer may both be outclassed in all aspects, but the Hell Metal Wheel paired with BD145 makes a decent Stamina type. Kerbecs' heavy weight makes it usable on Defense types. Also, EWD is top-tier for Stamina and is extremely useful in Spin-Stealing combinations. WD is top-notch for Stamina types as well, and DS is usable for Stamina too. In conclusion, this Set is a great purchase for Bladers without access to TAKARA-TOMY Beyblades or for starting Bladers looking to get some worthwhile parts conveniently.
