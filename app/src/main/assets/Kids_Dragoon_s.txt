Attack Ring (AR): Upper Dragoon Weight: 7 grams Upper Dragoon is the best AR for Upper Attack. Just from looking at it, you can see why this is. This AR has slopes that slant upwards to lift the opposing Beyblade off of the stadium floor. When this occurs, the opposing Beyblade has almost no Defense ability. They can take critical damage from this, and can be knocked out of the stadium. The slopes are also very long, making it more likely to have a successful Upper Attack. Use in Upper Attack Customization For Upper Attack to be successful, the slope of Upper Dragoon must be able to reach below the opposing Beyblade. Because of this, using a low BB will make the attack effective against more Beyblades. One of the lowest BB's available is Dragoon S's Storm Grip Base. Combining these two parts, you can make an Upper Attack combination that will repeatedly hit the opponent, reducing its Survival ability and possibly knocking it out. Here is an example combo: AR: Upper Dragoon (Master Dragoon, Kids Dragoon) WD: Ten Heavy SG: Neo-Right/Left SG Heavy Metal Core (Metal Driger) BB: Storm Grip Base (Dragoon S) Use in Defense Customization Upper Dragoon is almost perfectly round and is one of the heavier ARs. It can be used to effectively add some Attack ability to your Defense-type Beyblade.

Overall, however, most Bladers will be able to get by without it, and the fact that Kid Dragoon comes with no other parts of note means that it is not a must-have Beyblade. This Beyblade is not a must-have, but it is nevertheless a welcome addition to any collection. Retrieved from " http://wiki.worldbeyblade.org/index.php?title=Kids_Dragoon&oldid=12416"
