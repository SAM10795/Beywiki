This offers very little movement and as such offers no Attack potential. This part is also often thrown off balance and can be easily toppled over. This in turn sacrifices all Defense ability. While this can be used as an advantage in some situations, there are far better choices than this part for Survival types. It can be used in this customization as a 'Balance Beater': AR: Smash Turtle (Master Draciel/Kids Draciel) WD: Wide Survivor BB: Sharp Beyblades with this part Saizo Spark Knight Polta Bound Defenser Overall The Sharp BB as a part of the original 4-Layer Series does not even have the capability to swap SGs. This is what has made it severely outclassed when compared to the parts released afterwards. There is absolutely no reason for any Blader to desire to obtain this part outside of collection purposes.
