However, there are also traditional ways to win a battle: Spin Finish (outspin) Over Finish (knock out) Defeating a Beyblade by making its parts separate is called: Burst Finish Beyblade Burst gimmick demonstration BeyLogger The second most important gimmick announced by TAKARA-TOMY is represented by the BeyLogger, a device much like the BeyPointer that will connect to a smartphone to have real-time rankings and to add a Blader's own battling data to the list. This ranking system is part of something called the BeyCloud System. It uses NFC chip technology. Components of Beyblade Burst Going back to the very first generation of Beyblades (Bakuten Shoot Beyblade), Beyblades from the Beyblade Burst series are composed of three layers of parts: Layer: The main attacking piece, the Layer is made of plastic and displays its character's attributes. Disk: The Disk is a metallic ring that complements the shape of the Layer and adds a variety of weight distribution to the overall Beyblade customization. Driver: Similar to a Blade Base or a 4D Bottom, the Driver encases a tip and also determines the height of the Beyblade. It's made of plastic for the most. Beyblade Burst 3-layer parts: Layer, Disk & Driver Beyblade Burst parts New Stadium A new sort of BeyStadium accompanies the launch of this new Beyblade series: BeyStadium Standard Type. It resembles a mix of a regular stadium floor with a Zero-G cover on top of it, to protect players from exploding parts and high energy KOs. Types Beyblade Burst has introduced the same four types of Beyblade combos, with slightly different names: Striker Survivor Defender Balancer Size While this series bears resemblance to Plastics, their size is similar to Metal Fight Beyblades. Shooters Just like the Metal Fight Beyblade series, Beyblade Burst will see Starters and Boosters, with Starters including a Light Launcher. Although its name is identical to the Metal Fight Beyblade Light Launcher, the design for this winder-based shooter was changed. A BeyLauncher will also be released, at first in the Start Dash Set. It is a string launcher. Launcher Grips will be released separately. They are skinnier versions of the Metal Fight Beyblade Launcher Grips and the initial versions are white. They can accomodate the BeyLogger at their top, similar to the BeyPointer on the MFB grips.
