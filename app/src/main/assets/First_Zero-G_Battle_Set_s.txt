First Zero-G Battle Set - Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization First Zero-G Battle Set From Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization First Zero-G Battle Set Number: BBG-21 System: Beyblade Zero-G Contents 1 Contents 2 Overall 3 Gallery This Set was released by TAKARA-TOMY on August 11th 2012 for approximately 4095 yen. Contents Samurai Ifraid W145CF (Clear Yellow) Guardian Revizer 160SB (Clear Red Guardian, opaque Black Face, clear White 160SB) Zero-G Stadium Attack Type (Yellow tabs) Zero-G Compact Launcher (Gold) Zero-G Compact Launcher (Silver) Zero-G Road to Win Guide Overall The First Zero-G Battle Set contains interesting recolours, as well as some competitive parts like W145 and Revizer, however it is generally not worth purchasing this Set at that price. The Zero-G Stadium Attack Type, although good, is available in other Sets and separately; the Samurai Ifraid recolour is partially present in another product already; and it only comes with two Zero-G Compact Launchers, which are inferior to the Zero-G Light Launcher and the Zero-G Beylauncher. Furthermore, the Zero-G Road to Win Guide provides no particularly good and unknown information. In conclusion, especially if one started purchasing Zero-G products in its early months already, there is no reason to buy this Set besides for collection purposes.
