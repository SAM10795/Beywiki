Guardian Revizer 160SB Number: BBG-10 System: Beyblade Zero-G Type: Defense Element: Water Contents 1 Name Change 2 Stone Face: Revizer 3 Chrome Wheel: Revizer 4 Crystal Wheel: Guardian 5 Track: 160 6 Bottom: Sharp Ball 7 Other Versions 8 Gallery 8.1 Guardian Revizer 160SB - Original Version 8.2 Guardian Revizer 160SB - Hasbro Version 8.3 Orojya Revizer T125JB - Dark Blue Version 9 Overall Name Change Guardian Reviser is released by Hasbro as Guardian Leviathan 160SB. Stone Face: Revizer Weight: 1.2 grams The sticker for this aqua green Stone Face depicts a Leviathan. Chrome Wheel: Revizer Weight: 30.6 grams Revizer has a mostly circular shape for increased Defense, and its design is only interrupted by two holes that detail the fins on the Chrome Wheel. Overall, a very visible pattern of serpent heads, clawed feet, fins and spikes can be observed on Revizer's design. Crystal Wheel: Guardian Weight: 4.1 gram Full Width: 46.0 mm Minimum Width: 33.0 mm Full Height: 5.0 mm Height at borders: 3.0 mm This Crystal Wheel compliments Revizer exceptionally with its original release in clear blue-green. Although named Guardian, it acts as the water beneath the leviathan-inspired design of Revizer. Underneath the latter, Guardian barely protrudes and mostly provides bulged protection from lower Attacks. It embraces Revizer's shape completely, even following the curves of the holes which stop Revizer from being entirely circular. Track: 160 Weight: 2.1 grams Unlike the majority of the non-gimmick Tracks, 160 resembles 230 more than 145, with a round and large body around its hexagon-shaped core. This construction is probably meant to strengthen it, since chances of getting hit are relatively low compared to 230, and the stair-like design would have become too slim at this height. Bottom: Sharp Ball Weight: 0.6 gram Full Width: 15.91 mm Tip Width: 9.22 mm Full Height: 8.77 mm Tip Height: 5.01 mm Tip Angle: 25° SB is essentially cone-shaped, with a very subtle rounded tip at its end. It differs from BS exactly for that reason: while BS consists of a ball with a slight sharp tip, SB has the opposite with a sharp base that ends in a more ball-like tip.
