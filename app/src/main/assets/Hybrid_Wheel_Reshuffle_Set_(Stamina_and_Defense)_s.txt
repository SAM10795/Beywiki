Contents 1 Contents 2 Overall 3 Gallery Contents Thermal Pisces T125ES Rock Aries 145D (Teal Clear Wheel) Flame Libra DF145BS (Brown Clear Wheel) BeyLauncher (Black) Overall Although it contains interesting recolours, this Set is comprised almost exclusively of very outclassed parts. The only two competitively viable parts are D, and 145. D is top-tier for Stamina, and 145 has moderate uses for the same type, respectively, if AD145 or W145 are not available. The BeyLauncher is the most powerful launcher in MFB, and is preferred by most people. However, you can get D, 145 and the BeyLauncher in more competitive Sets and Beyblades. Overall, there is no reason to purchase this Set besides for collection purposes.
