Pirates Orojya 145D Number: BBG-08 System: Beyblade Zero-G Type: Stamina Element: Water Contents 1 Metal Stone Face: Orojya 2 Chrome Wheel: Orojya 3 Crystal Wheel: Pirates 4 Track: 145 5 Bottom: Defense 5.1 Use in Stamina customization 6 Other Versions 7 Gallery 7.1 Pirates Orojya 145D - Hasbro Version 7.2 Orojya Revizer T125JB Dark Blue Ver. 8 Overall Metal Stone Face: Orojya Weight: 5.5 grams Having its name based on Orochi, the eight-headed mythical serpent creature, the Face mark that can be applied on the BBG-08 Booster's Metal Stone Face shows snakes, however they're only at the number of three. Chrome Wheel: Orojya Weight: 29.4 grams This Chrome Wheel consists of a ring circled by multiple snakes. These engraved serpents create small protrusions all around Orojya, like a gear. Following the characteristic of all Zero-G Beyblades, Orojya has a hole for the Crystal Wheel's orb to protrude into, and two snake heads encase it from each side with their fangs. Some swirly designs exist in the inner part of this Chrome Wheel, all the way down to the opposite side of the crystal, where a menacing face is formed. Made to resemble a snake's head in a front view, two evil eyes are engraved as well as small fangs near the edge of Orojya, and that big head's apparent mustaches are prolonged to become the many small serpents encircling the rest of the Chrome Wheel. Crystal Wheel: Pirates Weight: 4.0 grams Pirates is a perfect vertical mirror of Orojya's sides. The combination of both creates a uniform pattern where Pirates continues the patterns of the snakes that are circled around Orojya's structure. Track: 145 Weight: 1.47 grams Full Width: 20 mm Minimum Width: 18 mm Height: 14.50 mm 145, along with its variants (C145, DF145, etc.), was once the highest Track available, until the 230 Track was released with Flame Byxis. It can be used in Stamina customs to great effect due to its tall height, which allows for more wobbling as the Beyblade loses its spin velocity. However, gimmick-paired Tracks like BD145 have immensely outclassed their original bare variant, on top of several taller gimmick Tracks surpassing 145 as well against heavy, mid-height Attackers. Even in Stamina battles, 145 does not offer enough balance: Tracks like AD145 and W145 provide a good center of gravity, and aid with a slight downforce to maintain stability. Bottom: Defense Weight: 0.68 gram Full Width: 15.55 mm Tip Width: 8.94 mm Full Height: 8.89 mm Tip Height: 7.59 mm Tip Angle: 35° This is a Defense Bottom, which acts as a wider version of a Sharp tip. When hit by an opponent, a Beyblade with this Bottom will have lessened recoil and will recover from attacks more efficiently than a Sharp Tip. However, while recovering, the Defense Bottom will cause the Beyblade to lose some stamina, caused by the added friction. Use in Stamina customization D can be put to use in the combination Scythe Bull 230D. D is a superior choice for 230 because it retains balance more easily than WD.
