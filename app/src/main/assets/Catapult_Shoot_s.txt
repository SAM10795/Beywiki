Catapult Shoot - Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization Catapult Shoot From Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization The Catapult Shoot is a shooting technique. To perform this technique, you must bend your left elbow while holding your shooter. When you are ready to launch, push your left hand forward (the one holding the shooter/grip), and your right hand (holding the winder) straight back to your side. This, combined with Banking is called the Sliding Shoot which will add different movement patterns to your Beyblade depending on the angle of your shot. It is also important to note that when first performing this technique, you must be positioned directly across from a wall so that your Beyblade will not bounce out of the stadium right at the beginning of the battle. When you have mastered the technique, the Beyblade should not even touch the wall. Retrieved from " http://wiki.worldbeyblade.org/index.php?title=Catapult_Shoot&oldid=1456"
