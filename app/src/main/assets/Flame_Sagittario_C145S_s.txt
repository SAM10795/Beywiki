Flame Sagittario C145S - Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization Flame Sagittario C145S From Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization Flame Sagittario C145S Number: BB-35 System: Hybrid Wheel System Type: Stamina Contents 1 Face: Sagittario 2 Clear Wheel: Sagittario 3 Metal Wheel: Flame 3.1 Use in Stamina Customization 4 Track: Claw 145 4.1 Use in Defense Customization 5 Bottom: Sharp 6 Other Versions 7 Gallery 8 Overall Face: Sagittario The Face on this Beyblade depicts Sagittarius, the ninth astrological sign in the zodiac. Sagittarius is the Archer, and this motif is prevalent in its Wheel?s design. This Face is manufactured as blank, and comes with 2 Face Stickers. Clear Wheel: Sagittario Weight: 2.8g The regular release of Sagittario is a yellow, translucent piece. It has several notches and protrusions. The design is loosely based on the original Sagittario, which features the two bow and arrows. Metal Wheel: Flame Weight: 32.5 grams The Metal Wheel Flame was first released with Flame Sagittario C145S. It is predominantly circular, with two small spikes and two additional smaller gaps on its circumference. The Wheel is relatively thin throughout, with the very edge of the Wheel being slightly thicker. Due to the design of Flame where the Wheel?s perimeter is raised slightly, more of the Track below is exposed compared to other Wheels, hence making it easier for other Beyblades to strike its Track. This significantly reduces its Defense capabilities. However, the raised perimeter allows slightly more wobbling time, as the raised track reduces floor scraping. Use in Stamina Customization Flame Bull DF145SD was a competitive Stamina customization, however it has been outclassed by Burn Bull DF145SD. Track: Claw 145 Weight: 3.2 grams Maximum Width: 34.0 mm Minimum Width: 27.0 mm Full Height: 14.50 mm Claws & Platform Height: 7.8 mm C145 has three wings which extend outwards, each separately joined onto the underside of the Track. These are free moving, and hence when the Beyblade is launched, these point outwards due to spin velocity. Their free moving nature make them very effective for defensive purposes, as they are able to withstand low hits to the Track without significant spin loss. Furthermore, the Track is significantly heavier than non-gimmicked Tracks such as 145, providing extra weight essential for Defense. As such, the Track is an essential part for current Defense customizations. But as the beyblade wobbles, the claws might have impact with the floor causing loss of balance, severe loss of stamina or resulting in the beyblade stops spinning. Use in Defense Customization When used in MF Earth Bull C145RS, the ?claws? which extend outwards provide a very significant protection against low attackers such as Quetzalcoatl 90RF. However, low attackers such as Quetzalcoatl 90RF have been outclassed, therefore C145 sees very little use, and has been replaced as a top-tier defence track by GB145 or 230. Bottom: Sharp Weight: 0.6 gram Full Width: 15.91 mm Tip Width: 4.14 mm Full Height: 8.83 mm Tip Height: 6.82 mm Tip Angle: 35° Sharp was released as Spike in the Hasbro release. The Sharp Bottom offers very little movement and as such provides no attack potential. The pointed tip allows for very little friction between the Bottom and the stadium surface, which helps prevent the loss of spin velocity. However, due to the fine nature of the tip, the Bottom is easily knocked off balance, and hence is outclassed by superior alternatives such as D or SD. Other Versions Clay Sagittario 145B ?

It offers unrivaled Defense capabilities against low Attack types, however, there is a lack of low top-tier attack type combinations in the MFB metagame, causing it to be outclassed. This Beyblade should only be bought for personal or collection purposes. Retrieved from " http://wiki.worldbeyblade.org/index.php?title=Flame_Sagittario_C145S&oldid=13482"
