Dark Wolf DF145FS - Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization Dark Wolf DF145FS From Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization Dark Wolf DF145FS Number: BB-29 System: Hybrid Wheel System Type: Balance Contents 1 Face: Wolf 2 Clear Wheel: Wolf 3 Metal Wheel: Dark 4 Track: Down Force 145 4.1 Use in Stamina Customization 5 Bottom: Flat Sharp 6 Other Versions 7 Gallery 8 Overall Face: Wolf The face on this Beyblade depicts Lupus, one of the 88 constellations in space. Clear Wheel: Wolf Weight: 3 grams The original release of Wolf is a dark brown, translucent plastic wheel. The edges of the Clear Wheel consists of 4 wolf 'heads', one in each quarter of the clear wheel, representing the body form of a Wolf, the symbol its design is influenced by. Metal Wheel: Dark Weight: 31.4 grams Dark has twelve spikes facing the clockwise direction. These protrusions are closely packed together with minimal space between each, resulting in an overall round shape. This shape hinders the Metal Wheel in two ways: its protrusions are not pronounced enough to provide sufficient Smash Attack, while the perimeter is interrupted too frequently for sufficient Stamina. Additionally, its weight is distributed over too large a surface area. There is thus no reason to use Dark in any competitive situation whatsoever. Track: Down Force 145 Weight: 1.5 grams Full Width: 21.53 mm Height: 14.50 mm DF145 has four upward facing wings protruding from the top of the Track, which aside from giving it extra weight are meant to push air downwards. It is on par with 145, while AD145 is superior by a small margin when used in Stamina combinations. Use in Stamina Customization If the aforementioned parts aren't accessible, DF145 can still be put to good use in the custom, Scythe Kronos DF145WD. Bottom: Flat Sharp Weight: 0.6 gram Full Width: mm Tip Width: mm Full Height: mm Tip Height: mm Sharp Tip Angle: 40° FS features a flat tip with a smaller, sharper tip in the centre. As a result, when launched at a straight angle, the Beyblade spins on this sharp tip, with very little movement. However, when tilted, either from the contact of an opposing Beyblade or from the launch, the Bottom moves in an offensive pattern. However, it suffers from the same problems as other Balance Bottoms, in that the two qualities are compromised, resulting in mediocre performance in both fields.
