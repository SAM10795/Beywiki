     <p>The purpose of this shooting technique is to land on top of your opponents Beyblade before yours has the chance to hit the stadium. Doing so will greatly reduce the <a href="javascript:void(0)" title="Survival" onclick="linkclick(this.id)" id="Survival.html"> endurance</a> or KO the opposing Beyblade. </p> 
     <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="How_To">How To</span></h2> 
     <p>To perform <strong class="selflink">Gattyaki</strong>, you must hit the opponents Beyblade on an angle before yours hits the stadium floor. To do this, you must launch a split second after them. Normally, when the countdowns, ?3..2..1.. Let it Rip!? or ?3..2..1..Go Shoot!? are chanted, players launch their Beyblade at the R of Rip or the S of Shoot. For this shot, you need to shoot at the P of Rip, or the T of Shoot. If you launch any later than this, it will not be a legal launch. If successful, your Beyblade will land on top of your opponents, causing them to be KOed, or at the very least, lose a great deal of their endurance. This technique is most effective when using heavy customizations, such as <a href="javascript:void(0)" title="Compact" onclick="linkclick(this.id)" id="Compact.html"> compacts</a>. The heavy weight of compacts is significant when performing Gattyaki because every extra gram of weight will add more force to the impact of your Beyblade when it hits. </p> 
     <p><br /> Gattyaki is very difficult to aim, and more often than not, you will end up missing. However, it should not be a problem for the rest of the battle unless something unexpected occurs. </p>
