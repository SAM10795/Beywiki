Due to its shape and design; this AR has little use and is incredibly outclassed, having no use except for WD Attack customizations, which as a whole are not competitively viable. Use in WD Attack Customization Cross Dragon in a WD Attack customization. Cross Dragon barely extends beyond Wide Defense, leaving it completely exposed, allowing this customization to be quite effective at WD Attack. AR: Cross Dragon (Megaro Arm) WD: Wide Defense SG: Neo Right SG (Heavy Metal Core) BB: SG Metal Flat Base (Gaia Dragoon V) IMPORTANT: Mold Variations There are two different molds for Cross Dragon. The original mold of Cross Dragon (Ultimate Dragoon and Megaro Arm version) is very thin and fragile (prone to breaking). The newer mold of Cross Dragon (Makendo version) is much improved from the original version, in that the AR is made thicker and the width of the AR is increased. In the newer mold of Cross Dragon, reinforments have been added to the ring and to the four panels. Due to these improvements, the newer mold AR is much stronger and less likely to break, compared to the original mold. Should Cross Dragon be used, the newer mold (Makendo's Cross Dragon) should be used over the original mold AR. Note: The Hasbro versions of Ultimate Dragoon, Megaro Arm and Makendo all have the newer mold of Cross Dragon. Weight Disk (WD): Heavy See Heavy Weight Disk. Blade Base (BB): Flat Base See Flat Base. Other Versions Ultimate Dragoon Makendo Gallery Hasbro Megaro Arm Box Takara Megaro Arm Package Overall Megaro Arm is useless for competitive play and all of its parts have been entirely outclassed by later releases.
