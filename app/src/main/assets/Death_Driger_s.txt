Attack Ring (AR): Star Shape As the name suggests, Star Shape is in the shape of a star. It is one of the smallest ARs ever made. There is no competitive uses for Star Shape, except on WD Attack customizations, which are essentially useless in competitive play as well. Use in WD Attack Customization Star Shape's only possible use is in WD Attacking customs.

This Beyblade is only worth buying for collection purposes. Retrieved from " http://wiki.worldbeyblade.org/index.php?title=Death_Driger&oldid=12329"
