However, there are many problems with these metal protrusions that negate the use of Wolf; the largest one being that the spikes face counter-clockwise, which causes a massive decrease in stamina when the other, right-spin Beyblade hits it. Because of the counter-clockwise facing spikes, its potential to Smash Attack is also hindered because of its own spin direction, which causes the flatter side of the spikes hit to the opposing top. </p>

     <p>This Wheel is generally rounded with four textured fins protruding from its circumference, forming waves. Between these fins are empty semicircles used to prevent (early) breakage. Aquario, just like <a href="javascript:void(0)" title="Wolf D125B" onclick="linkclick(this.id)" id="Wolf_D125B.html#Wheel:_Wolf"> Wolf</a>, has its protrusions facing the opposite way to its spin direction, presumably to avoid the massive <a href="javascript:void(0)" title="Recoil" onclick="linkclick(this.id)" id="Recoil.html">Recoil</a> that would be experienced if they had been facing the right direction. Since only the rounded parts of the protrusions can be used for <a href="javascript:void(0)" title="Attack" onclick="linkclick(this.id)" id="Attack.html">Attack</a>, its offensive potential is mediocre. The considerable space between each wave also prevents it from being efficient in <a href="javascript:void(0)" title="Defense" onclick="linkclick(this.id)" id="Defense.html">Defense</a> and <a href="javascript:void(0)" title="Survival" onclick="linkclick(this.id)" id="Survival.html"> Stamina</a>, as it would need a more united, even rounder shape.

     <p>One very important thing to note is the different mold variations that have been discovered for Virgo. Just looking at the Wheels themselves, it is impossible to tell what the actual difference in the mold is. However, through testing, it has been determined that there is balance issues that certain Virgo Wheels encounter. Some of them have been reported not having a solo spin time above three minutes while others are able to spin for over five minutes. The disparities between the Virgo Wheels cannot be ignored, so it is encouraged to test your Virgo Wheel by itself before using it. </p>

     <p>Rock has 3 different Molds: 0 Cylinders (31.4 grams), 3 Cylinders (32.6 grams), and 6 Cylinders (32.7 grams). The 0 Cylinder Mold is only available from TAKARA-TOMY products, while the 3 and 6 Cylinder Molds are available from both Takara Tomy and Hasbro products. Rock suffers from recoil, but the best way to tame this is to use a Mold with more Cylinders, as more Cylinders result in less Recoil. The 6 Cylinder Mold has the most Stamina of the three, due to the weight of the Cylinders carrying the momentum around the outside of the wheel. It is also superior to the other Molds, in terms of attack and defense. </p>

     <p>The Metal Wheel Flame was first released with Flame Sagittario C145S. It is predominantly circular, with two small spikes and two additional smaller gaps on its circumference. The Wheel is relatively thin throughout, with the very edge of the Wheel being slightly thicker. Due to the design of Flame where the Wheel?s perimeter is raised slightly, more of the Track below is exposed compared to other Wheels, hence making it easier for other Beyblades to strike its Track. This significantly reduces its <a href="javascript:void(0)" title="Defense" onclick="linkclick(this.id)" id="Defense.html">Defense</a> capabilities. However, the raised perimeter allows slightly more wobbling time, as the raised track reduces floor scraping. </p>

Though a good Attack Wheel, Lightning faced problems in beating heavier Defense wheels, most notably Basalt; which was over 17 grams heavier than Lightning. It was also directly outclassed by Blitz and VariAres upon their release in terms of pure Smash Attack. Not only do they both provide better Smash Attack, but they are also significantly heavier; a common attribute among 4D System Metal Wheels when compared to previously released Wheels in the Hybrid Wheel System. </p>

The wings also have a noticeable slope leading up to the thicker center. However, despite this slope, Thermal generates no observable Upper Attack. In addition, even though it has relatively sharp contact points, they do not protrude far enough outward to provide any significant Smash Attack. Although Thermal?s design is mostly continuous and interrupted by only the two small gaps, but it has only moderate Stamina qualities at best, and is outclassed by multiple Stamina Wheels such as even Earth and Burn. </p>

     <p>Burn is an almost completely circular Metal Wheel, interrupted only by two sets of wave-like ridges. The center of the Metal Wheel features a flame pattern representing the sun, which complements the Phoenix Clear Wheel. Burn's predominant characteristic is its weight distribution&nbsp;: the weight is concentrated on the edge of the Metal Wheel, while the center is generally hollow and light. This produces what is known as the Flywheel Effect, which is the ability for a rotating object to increase its rotational velocity with the use of its own momentum. The ridges are subject to some level of recoil, but are also capable of <a href="javascript:void(0)" title="Smash Attack" onclick="linkclick(this.id)" id="Smash_Attack.html">Smash Attack</a>; however, the latter is not potent enough to be used effectively. </p> 
     <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="IMPORTANT:_Mold_Variations_5">IMPORTANT: Mold Variations</span></h3> 
     <p>Burn has a total of four molds, three of them released by <a href="javascript:void(0)" title="TAKARA-TOMY" onclick="linkclick(this.id)" id="TAKARA-TOMY.html">TAKARA-TOMY</a> and one released by <a href="javascript:void(0)" title="Hasbro" onclick="linkclick(this.id)" id="Hasbro.html">Hasbro</a>. The TAKARA-TOMY molds have the phrase &quot;Burn Wheel&quot; engraved between each set of ridges while the Hasbro mold does not. Mold 1 is the lightest of the four molds and is usually the one preferred for Stamina customizations. The gaps on the underside of the Metal Wheel are lengthier on Mold 2 than on Mold 1, while the gaps on Mold 3 are both lengthier and wider. The Hasbro mold is generally heavier because of the absence of engravings and thus preferred for Attack and Defense customizations, although those combinations have no prevalence. </p>

There are more bumps and curves on the side of Mold One than there are on Mold Two. Mold Two is found in most SonoKong Gravity Perseus and is smooth all around the sides, and is significantly lighter than Mold One. Its performance in all areas suffers from this weight difference. The toughest Mold to distinguish is Mold Three. It is found in BB-109 Random Booster Volume 7, and is the same shape as Mold One.

     <p>Bakushin is an originally white Metal Wheel made in a circular shape with very small V-shaped gaps which are approximately one millimeter deep. As a whole, this Metal Wheel resembles a rock with declinations of varying steepness and carved ridges here and there. Although it generally performs in a mediocre way, some testing has showed that it has some decent Stamina and OK Attack despite its inferior weight. Its highest potential lies in its apparent defensive capabilities, however, due to its physical compatibility with BD145 where very little space is left between the Metal Wheel and the Track. In fact, even at the time of its release, it equaled Earth compared to the top-tier Attack types of that period, but the fact that Bakushin was painted repelled Bladers from testing it extensively. On average, however, especially with 4D parts available, Bakushin should only be used as a very last resort. Even with its potential in a few different Beyblade types, it could overall almost be classified as outclassed even following its release, since it possesses the flaws of most Balance-type parts that try to do well in several categories but fail to excel anywhere. </p>

     <p>Basalt is a completely circular Metal Wheel, with sets of indents distributed around its circumference and is almost cylindrical in its thickness, part of which overhangs the Track being used in conjunction with it. </p> 
     <p>Basalt is a member of the Maximum Series, with its &quot;gimmick&quot; being &quot;maximum weight&quot;. At the time of its release, it was the heaviest Metal Wheel ever created, even heavier and thicker than the infamous <a href="javascript:void(0)" title="Libra DF145BS" onclick="linkclick(this.id)" id="Libra_DF145BS.html">Libra</a>. With the release of Diablo it is no longer the heaviest Metal Wheel, but Basalt's circular nature, in combination with its abnormally heavy weight, make it without a doubt one of the best Metal Wheels for Defense customizations. </p> 
     <p>However, Basalt is missing a chunk of metal inside its perimeter which forms what is called the &quot;<i>Spiral Staircase of Death</i>&quot;. The &quot;Spiral Staircase of Death&quot; was meant to neuter Basalt's incredibly high power slightly by creating an imbalance within the Wheel. While this imbalance does indeed occur, it is not a notable hindrance to its usefulness. In fact, despite the imbalance/wobbling caused by the &quot;Spiral Staircase of Death&quot;, Basalt also has strong Stamina, although it has since been outclassed by Scythe and Phantom. The imbalance/wobbling caused by the &quot;Spiral Staircase of Death&quot; does contribute slightly to the <a href="javascript:void(0)" title="Recoil" onclick="linkclick(this.id)" id="Recoil.html">Recoil</a> Basalt suffers, but again, this is not a huge hindrance to its usefulness. </p>

     <p>Big Bang is a unique Metal Wheel. It has three &quot;wings&quot;, each etched with the intricate design of feathers. It is separated into three parts, the PC Frame, the Metal Frame, and the Core. </p> 
     <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="PC_Frame">PC Frame</span></h4> 
     <ul> 
      <li><b>Weight:</b> 2.50 grams</li> 
     </ul> 
     <p>The PC Frame is the plastic and top part of Big Bang. It has three sets of two square holes underneath it that connect with the Metal Frame. When rotated, the cubes on the Metal Frame that the holes connect to are inserted in a different hole, changing the mode of the PC Frame. It is dyed red and is made of polycarbonate, but it is generally too far away and too incrusted inside the Metal Wheel to really come into contact with an opposing Beyblade and absorb the shock as it should. </p> 
     <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Metal_Frame">Metal Frame</span></h4> 
     <ul> 
      <li><b>Weight:</b> 25.48 grams</li> 
     </ul> 
     <p>The Metal Frame is the main and middle part of Big Bang. It has three cubes on the top that connect to holes in the PC Frame. It also has three sets of two holes on the underside that allow a mode change with the Core's own cubes. As its name suggests, it is made of metal, and it contains most of the feather details in Big Bang?s design. </p> 
     <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Core">Core</span></h4> 
     <ul> 
      <li><b>Weight:</b> 13.81 grams</li> 
     </ul> 
     <p>The Core is the bottom part of Big Bang. It connects with the Metal Frame with cubes that get inserted in the Metal Frame?s holes. It is the part that the Track and Clear Wheel attach to. It is also made of metal, and is shaped mostly like lower wings full of small feathers that complement the Metal Frame's design. </p> 
     <p>By turning the PC Frame and Core, you can make four different modes: </p> 
     <hr /> 
     <ul> 
      <li> <b>Smash Attack Mode</b></li> 
     </ul> 
     <p>The PC Frame blocks the upper part of the hole between the Metal Frame's wings, and the Core is retreated closer to the end of the Metal Frame's feathers, to create a bigger wing. </p> 
     <ul> 
      <li> <b>Upper Attack Mode</b></li> 
     </ul> 
     <p>The slope of the PC Frame aligns with the angle of the Metal Frame's wings, and the Core fits more under the holes between the Metal Frame's wings. </p>

     <p>This Metal Wheel is made up of two parts: a Core and a Metal Frame. Unlike other 4D Metal Wheels, the Core is made of rubber/plastic and sits below?rather than above?the Metal Frame, which comprises the bulk of the Metal Wheel. This follows the trend of the other L Drago Wheels. </p>

     <ul> 
      <li><b>Weight:</b> 38.51 grams</li> 
     </ul> 
     <p>The Metal Frame is the largest part of the Metal Wheel and therefore makes the most contact with opposing Beyblades. Like previous L Drago Wheels, the three-sided Metal Frame is shaped to resemble three dragon heads. It is much wider, has larger gaps between each head, and is significantly heavier than each of the former L Drago Wheels, many of which were notorious for their extremely light weight. While made entirely of metal, it was given a gunmetal finish upon release. Its relief features some slight, jagged bumps instead of being very smooth, to create an overall fierce design. </p> 
     <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Core_2">Core</span></h4> 
     <ul> 
      <li><b>Weight:</b> 5.82 grams</li> 
     </ul> 
     <p>L-Drago Destroy's Core is made of PC (plastic) as well as PVC (rubber), continuing the trend started with Meteo L-Drago. It is comprised of six protrusions which act as the teeth and lower jaw for the dragon heads; all six contain rubber, but only three expose rubber on the outside, while the other three expose plastic. The rubber protrusions can assist in spin stealing from right-spin Beyblades. </p> 
     <p><br /> Like all 4D Metal Wheels, L-Drago Destroy features a mode-changing gimmick. It works by rotating the Metal Frame while the Beyblade is disassembled. The two Modes are: </p> 
     <hr /> 
     <ul>

     <ul> 
      <li> <b>Absorb Mode</b>: In this mode, the Core is rotated 180&deg; so that the plastic protrusions on the Core are aligned with the front of the dragon heads of the Metal Frame.</li>

     <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="PC_Frame_2">PC Frame</span></h4> 
     <p>The PC Frame of this 4D Metal Wheel is the piece that acts as the primary mechanism behind its Mode Change. There are triangular designs on each side of the PC Frame resembling cat ears; the weight is mainly focused on these opposite ends of the Frame. </p>

These protrusions produce ferocious <a href="javascript:void(0)" title="Smash Attack" onclick="linkclick(this.id)" id="Smash_Attack.html">Smash Attack</a>, but unfortunately also create <a href="javascript:void(0)" title="Recoil" onclick="linkclick(this.id)" id="Recoil.html">Recoil</a>.

     <p>VariAres is unarguably the most aggressively designed Wheel ever released in MFB, and is the second Metal Wheel capable of spinning in both Left and Right Spin (the first being Gravity Perseus). It has a relatively thick, wide three-winged design. Each wing ends in an abrupt, sharp point that provides intense <a href="javascript:void(0)" title="Smash Attack" onclick="linkclick(this.id)" id="Smash_Attack.html">Smash Attack</a> in both spin directions. In addition to this, along each wing there are six indents of varying size that provide <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="new" title="Spike Attack (page does not exist)" onclick="linkclick(this.id)" id="1.html">Spike Attack</a> which works in tandem with the sharp Smash Attack points on the ends of each wing. However, while VariAres' Attack power may be high, it does suffer from huge amounts of <a href="javascript:void(0)" title="Recoil" onclick="linkclick(this.id)" id="Recoil.html">Recoil</a> because it is so aggressively designed. This can make VariAres a risky Wheel to use in some respects, but as the game has evolved, lighter, more compact Attack Wheels such as <a href="javascript:void(0)" title="Lightning LDrago 100HF" class="mw-redirect" onclick="linkclick(this.id)" id="Lightning_L_Drago_100HF.html"> Lightning</a> have become harder and harder to use effectively without the assistance of something like BD145. VariAres can backfire due to its recoil, but it does not need the width and weight of BD145 to be effective. </p> 
     <p>Between each wing is a large gap. Fitted in between these gaps is a yellow PC Frame, that protrudes outwards in a triangular shape as far as the Metal Frame. Unlike other 4D Beyblades, VariAres' PC Frame is built in conjunction with the Metal Frame. On the bottom side of the Metal Wheel where the mechanism that controls the plastic wings release are located, there is cover of a hard plastic sheet. </p>

     <p>Jade is made up of two parts: a Core and a Metal Frame. The gimmick of this 4D Metal Wheel is that it has four metal balls in its Frame, reminiscent of <a href="javascript:void(0)" title="Earth Virgo GB145BS" onclick="linkclick(this.id)" id="Earth_Virgo_GB145BS.html">GB145</a>.

     <ul> 
      <li><b>Weight:</b> 22.28 grams</li> 
     </ul> 
     <p>The Frame of this Beyblade consists of four long divisions, which hang over the sides irregularly. Each of these contains one metal ball. There are also four hollowed out areas, other than the ones that contain the spheres, on the inner area of the Frame. The underside is made up of magenta plastic, attached to the Frame with screws, which keep the balls in their spaces. </p> 
     <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Core_4">Core</span></h4> 
     <ul> 
      <li><b>Weight:</b> 16.87 grams</li> 
     </ul> 
     <p>Jade's Core is of a circular shape with four rounded square protrusions, one in each corner. Each of these protrusions has a vertical metal stick attached to it. These can be inserted into two places on the Frame, either in the slots of the metal balls or an area away from them to create the two modes mentioned earlier, since they immobilize the balls, or let them roll freely. The Core also has holes on its outer rim creating a gear-like shape. </p> 
     <p><br /> This 4D Metal Wheel can be placed in two different modes by rotating the Metal Frame. </p>

     <p>In this mode, the metal pieces on the Core are pushed into the slots for the balls, fixing them in place closer to the center of the Beyblade. </p>

Overall, this Jade therefore weighs significantly less than the original, but due to the fact that it leaves huge gaps between what is essentially the Metal Frame's side extensions, it still succeeds in delivering decent <a href="javascript:void(0)" title="Smash Attack" onclick="linkclick(this.id)" id="Smash_Attack.html">Smash Attack</a>. However, this performance is nothing compared to previously released Wheels such as Flash. The Hasbro version of Jade also only appears to do well with largely advantageous Tracks such as E230; the gaps are otherwise a huge detriment. It was therefore heavily outclassed already upon release. </p>

     <p>The Metal Frame of this 4D Metal Wheel is the piece that acts as the primary mechanism behind its Mode Change. It has three small protrusions, which fit in with the gaps in the Core, and the protrusions are smaller than each protrusion on the Core. </p>

     <p>Blitz's Core has three separate primary contact points, whereupon the metal slopes down and outward into a finer surface, creating &quot;bumps&quot; on the front-most portion of each wing segment. These slopes provide an advantage in the form of allowing maximum contact with the primary contact points, and often throwing the opposing Wheel slightly off balance when used on a lower Track. </p>

On each is engraved two shallow holes where stickers can be applied to depict a total of four blue stars, which, combined with Orion's Face's three blue flames, form the Orion constellation.

         Death Quetzalcoatl 4D Metal Wheel (Defense Mode) 
       </div> 
      </div> 
     </div> 
     <p>The gimmick introduced in this 4D Metal Wheel is that one of the two metal parts, the Metal Frame, can be flipped to form another mode. Death has no PC Frame, only metal pieces, which makes it one of the heaviest 4D Metal Wheels available. </p> 
     <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Metal_Frame_6">Metal Frame</span></h4> 
     <ul> 
      <li><b>Weight:</b></li> 
     </ul> 
     <p>The Metal Frame of this 4D Metal Wheel is the piece that acts as the primary mechanism behind its Mode Change. It has four small indents which act as a locking mechanism when placed on the Core. On the Defense side it has eight shallow slopes with a reptile-like texture and the large slopes of the Attack mode connect perfectly with the Core's. On the Attack side, as previously mentioned, there are eight significantly larger slopes each with the face of a serpent sculpted in. </p> 
     <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Core_7">Core</span></h4> 
     <ul> 
      <li><b>Weight:</b></li> 
     </ul> 
     <p>As with any other Core in 4D, this part connects the Wheel with the Track. Its design is based on wings, so the combination of the Metal Frame and the Core indeed illustrate a winged serpent, which is the representation of Quetzalcoatl. </p> 
     <p>Like all 4D Metal Wheels, Death features a mode changing gimmick. It works by flipping the Metal Frame on the opposite side while the Beyblade is disassembled. The two Modes are: </p> 
     <hr /> 
     <ul> 
      <li> <b>Attack Mode</b></li> 
     </ul> 
     <p>If Death is set in Attack Mode, the Metal Frame shows details of several serpent heads with fangs, enhancing the term &quot;Attack&quot;. This mode is in no way more useful than Defense Mode as it does not provide sufficient Smash Attack to be of any use in Attack Type customs, and its Recoil renders it useless when compared to Defense Mode for other areas. </p> 
     <ul> 
      <li> <b>Defense Mode</b></li> 
     </ul> 
     <p>If the Metal Frame is completely flipped to be in Defense Mode, this other side reveals a design of serpent scales, which relates to the term &quot;Defense&quot; and how animals defend themselves with their back, their scales, etc. Defense Mode's top half is also sloped, which reduces Recoil and is also an uncommon trait among Metal Wheels. </p>

     <p>Duo is formed of series of spirals seemingly emitted from the centre, as if they were wind gushes, again linking back to the wind theme of the Beyblade as a whole. This 4D Metal Wheel is made up of two components: The upper half is the Metal Frame?which is the basis of the mode change?and the Core, which supports the Metal Frame, as well as denoting the mode and playing a small part therein. </p> 
     <p>Duo's gimmick relates to balance: in Stamina Mode, it is well balanced, and in Attack Mode, it is greatly off-balance. This mode change is done by rotating the Metal Frame 90 degrees clockwise, or 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Doing so, however, requires disassembly of the Beyblade. </p>

     <p>Duo's Metal Frame has a completely circular perimeter, while its top side contains the main visual design of the Duo Wheel, the aforementioned spiral pattern. The most interesting aspect of the Metal Frame is how it makes the mode change work: on the underside, there is a wall only on one part, which either protrudes over one side of the Core, focusing the weight on that side of the Metal Wheel, or fits in perfectly to the side 90 degrees counter-clockwise of this, balancing out a slightly lighter section of the core, resulting in a very well-balanced Metal Wheel. </p>

     <p>The Core is the heavier part of the Duo 4D Metal Wheel. It has eight separate sections, four raised, and four indented. The raised sections are identical, and these support the Metal Frame and have slightly jagged tops, intended to grind down opponents, though in battle, the small vertical gaps they leave do not have any noticeable effect. </p>

When the wall of the Metal Frame is placed here, it evens out the weight discrepancy between these two points, resulting in a well balanced wheel. This is Stamina Mode. </p>

         Wing 4D Metal Wheel (Ironclad Attack Mode) 
       </div> 
      </div> 
     </div> 
     <p>In general, Wing is a remolded version of Big Bang. Its 4D gimmick is not new, and at first sight, it could seem completely negligible, seeing as there are barely any differences between the modes physically. Surprisingly, Wing's performance varies from Big Bang. </p> 
     <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Metal_Frame_8">Metal Frame</span></h4> 
     <ul> 
      <li><b>Weight:</b> 16.6 grams</li> 
     </ul> 
     <p>The Metal Frame is Wing's thinnest part. It consists of a circle frame with three protrusions in the shape of triangles. Each of those protrusions has an inclination, a size and a height which varies ever-so-slightly from the others. On the underside of the Metal Frame are two small walls to lock into the Core. Most importantly though, on the top, there's an arrow engraved in it. Depending on where this arrow is positioned on the Core, the mode changes, and different protrusions of the Metal Frame are exposed out of the Core's wings. </p> 
     <p><br /> In Ironclad Attack Mode, there are no protrusions particularly sticking out. Thus, this mode is more defensive. It's also referred to as being &quot;0&quot;: it has no intentional attacking points. </p> 
     <p>In Mortal Blow Attack Mode, also &quot;1&quot;, there's one protrusion that is farther from the center than the others, therefore this irregularity in the circular shape of Wing creates one point of Attack. The protrusion out in the open in this mode is more or less isolated from the two wings of the Core that are besides it. </p> 
     <p>In Pound Attack Mode, there are two protrusions that are active while the third one is closer to the Core, and mixes in with its circular shape more. Wing has the most offensive properties in this mode. </p>

      <li><b>Weight:</b> 28.5 grams</li> 
     </ul> 
     <p>Wing's Core is very bulky. In general, it is made to resemble a unified Big Bang, therefore it has three wings which bear feather designs. The space between each wing varies slightly in order to allow different protrusions of the Metal Frame to stick out: some of the areas are bigger, some are smaller. To help the recognition of the three modes made possible with Wing, numbers are engraved inside the Core, on its top, for each of its wings. For instance, when you align the arrow on the Metal Frame with the number &quot;0&quot;, Wing is in Ironclad Attack Mode; when &quot;1&quot; is chosen, it's in Mortal Blow Attack Mode; etc. </p>

     <p>L Drago Guardian's Metal Frame is heavily inspired from L Drago Destroy, hence the name similarities. In fact, the shapes are almost identical, but L Drago Guardian was made to resemble three dragon heads adorned by armours, so the relief on this part is more inexistent and the jagged edges of L Drago Destroy are replaced by smooth angles. These armours are cut into overlapping segments, which create the only relief on the Metal Frame. There are some ornaments on the end of each segment, and each of the three dragon heads is designed to have a helmet too. </p> 
     <p>In Attack Mode, the heads of the Metal Frame are on top of the outer rubber parts of the Core, making more of the Metal Frame be open for contact. </p>

     <p>Diablo is the heaviest standalone Metal Wheel ever released. Like the other parts of Diablo Nemesis X:D, the Diablo 4D Metal Wheel incorporates several 4D Beyblade design points in its overall schema. Because Kreis Cygnus was not out at the time of Diablo Nemesis's release, the latter's 4D Metal Wheel was the first to introduce a semi-free-spinning gimmick in Metal Fight Beyblade. The placement of the Metal Frame in Ultimate Balance Mode was also new to the hobby. </p> 
     <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Metal_Frame_10">Metal Frame</span></h4> 
     <ul> 
      <li><b>Weight:</b> 25.35 grams</li> 
     </ul> 
     <p>Diablo?s Metal Frame consists of three mugshot heads distributed around its circumference. The biggest head is a lion?s head, depicting Leone, with red eyes and the top row of teeth. Part of the lion?s mane is visible around the head. The smallest of the three heads is a lynx?s head, from Lynx, with yellow-black cat eyes and two paws. Again, only the upper row of teeth is visible on this head. The last of the three heads, with an intermediate size, is derived from Orion, and shows Orion?s face from the Phantom Metal Wheel in Stamina mode with blue eyes and a full snarl on its face, unlike the smirk seen on the original 4D Metal Wheel. </p> 
     <p>Since the Metal Frame simply rests in the space between the elevated Core and the 4D Bottom when in Ultimate Balance Mode, it can rotate freely to a point: spinning on its own, the Metal Frame would not rotate independently. It is the impact of the opposing Beyblade that will make it spin semi-freely towards the right or towards the left depending on the spin direction of the opponent, trajectory, and angle of impact. The Metal Frame has one of three positions it pauses on after each impact due to the Metal Frame's three-headed shape. These positions push down on the small pins on top of X:D with varying force and activate the descent or retraction of the sharp tip from X:D, either completely or only half-way, consequently changing the Beyblade's behavior. </p> 
     <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Core_11">Core</span></h4> 
     <ul> 
      <li><b>Weight:</b> 25.94 grams</li> 
     </ul> 
     <p>The design of the underside of Diablo?s Core originates from the Scythe 4D Metal Wheel on Kronos and allows for smooth rotation of the Metal Frame when in Ultimate Balance Mode. The Core depicts one of Unicorno II?s heads, originating from the Unicorno II 4D Clear Wheel, connected to the bones from Quetzalcoatl's 4D Metal Wheel on one side, with the wings of Pegasis III's 4D Clear Wheel on the other side linked to a dragon head derived from L-Drago III's 4D Metal Wheel. On the side of Quetzalcoatl's and Unicorno II's sections is an irregular, jagged edge reminiscent of Hades' 4D Metal Wheel. In front of the unicorn head is a small portion resembling a scythe from Kronos' 4D Metal Wheel, which is connected to a section of a bow from Sagittario?s Clear[b] W[b]heel. Finally, in between the wings of Pegasis and the bow of Sagittario is a section derived from the wings of VariAres' 4D Metal Wheel. </p> 
     <p>Like all 4D Metal Wheels, Diablo has a mode change. This is performed by flipping the Metal Frame and placing it under the metal frame. However, this mode change is unique because it requires the X:D 4D Bottom in order to stay in place and work. The two modes are: </p> 
     <hr /> 
     <ul> 
      <li> <b>Attack Mode</b>: The normal mode for Diablo Nemesis; the Metal Frame lies on top of the Core in an upright position with the heads facing upright as well. The difference in the heights of each head, with Lynx's head being the smallest, creates varying relief around the Clear Wheel. In this mode, one can manually choose between XF or S on X:D before the beginning of the battle without any automatic changes occurring.</li> 
     </ul> 
     <ul> 
      <li> <b>Ultimate Balance Mode</b>: It is the X:D-exclusive mode. the Metal Frame lies upside-down underneath the Core. The Clear Wheel is fully exposed and X:D is holding the Metal Frame in place underneath the Core. The Metal Frame can spin freely and change the tip of X:D when contact is made on itself.</li>

     <p>Fusion is the first 4D Metal Wheel to include a full rubber part. Its Metal Frame and its Rubber Frame lock in with a simple square teeth system, and the same mechanism is used for the Core. </p>

     <p>It is shaped like a circle with only a few reliefs in the form of bumps on the circumference. In its center ridge, there are four rectangles cut into it, which allows the Metal Frame to slide into the Core and lock well without rattling. There are also two slightly angled parts on each side of the Metal Frame which seem to complete the shape of the shields on the Hades Clear Wheel. </p>

     <p><br /> In Defense Mode, the Rubber Frame is on top of the Metal Frame, which helps absorb the impacts from other Beyblades. </p> 
     <p>When in Balance Mode, the combination of the Rubber and Metal Frames is flipped to show the metal part on top. Its roundness helps keep balance, hence the name of the mode. </p>

     <p>Its Core is of a regular shape which has rectangular forms to help lock the Metal Frame and Rubber Frame onto it. This part is the only one from the Fusion 4D Metal Wheel that remains in the same position for the mode changes. </p>

     <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Kreis">Kreis</span></h2> 
     <ul> 
      <li><b>Weight:</b> 42.62 grams</li> 
     </ul> 
     <p>Kreis was meant to introduce the gimmick of a relatively free-spinning Metal Frame, but it was released after Diablo Nemesis, which shares its gimmick in one of its modes. This Metal Wheel is incredibly circular, hence its name: &quot;kreis&quot; means &quot;circle&quot; in German. </p> 
     <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Metal_Frame_12">Metal Frame</span></h4> 
     <ul> 
      <li><b>Weight:</b> 21.58 grams</li> 
     </ul> 
     <p>Most of the relief on this part is present on its upper side. Two sets of protrusions line up the Metal Frame to form a sort of fa&ccedil;ade or fortification. As such, the sides represent two engraved swans, and it is their heads and their wings that protrude upward. The heads are the smallest parts and they appear on each side of the Metal Frame. Each swan's wings spread out on either side of it, and the locations where both swan's wings touch constitute the other protrusions, which extend for a bigger portion of the circumference. The space between each shape can have blue stickers applied to it. The rest of the sides of Kreis's Metal Frame have additional relief made from engraved feathers, and superficial semi-circle holes in four places. </p> 
     <p>On its underside, this part is simply a hollowed circle. On its flat bottom, swirly patterns are engraved all over, and a short wall follows its circumference. </p> 
     <p><br /> In Defense Mode, the Metal Frame is partially free-spinning. In fact, this gimmick is called &quot;sliding&quot;. It can only move back and forth for approximately 90&deg;. On the underside of the Metal Frame are four small squares evenly placed around its inner hole. The Core also has four similar squares, and the way the Metal Frame is positioned on the Core, it can rotate freely until one of its cubes meet one of the Core's. At that point, it could only rotate in the other direction back to the next square. The Metal Frame can additionally absorb hits thanks to the free movement. This sliding is surprisingly smooth even though there are no other materials than the metal the parts are made of. </p> 
     <p>As is often the case with 4D Metal Wheels, Attack Mode is accomplished by flipping the Metal Frame and placing it back on the Core in this new position. This shows the Metal Frame's underside which is still very circular and only has the even, small wall at its circumference as Attack points. The Clear Wheel is slightly more exposed in Attack Mode. The protrusions that are the heads and the wings engraved on the Metal Frame fit perfectly in the holes of the Core in this mode, which prevents it from rotating in any way. </p> 
     <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Core_13">Core</span></h4>

     </ul> 
     <p>Kreis's Core is banal except for some shapes that are meant to embrace those of the Metal Frame's protrusions when it is in Attack Mode. Furthermore, it has four small cubes of metal in its inner part that offer a given, limited space for the Metal Frame to rotate in Defense Mode. </p>

     <ul> 
      <li><b>Weight:</b> 45.6 grams</li> 
     </ul> 
     <p>In coordination with the theme of the Sagittario II 4D Clear Wheel, Flash is an assembly of many bow-and-arrow illustrations. The gimmick used for Flash's mode change is not new at all, despite <a href="javascript:void(0)" title="TAKARA-TOMY" onclick="linkclick(this.id)" id="TAKARA-TOMY.html">TAKARA-TOMY</a>'s designers having more creative ideas originally<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://my.takaratomy-business-service.co.jp/community/beyblade/2012/02/post-73.html">[1]</a>. </p> 
     <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Metal_Frame_13">Metal Frame</span></h4> 
     <p>Flash's Metal Frame resembles the Flame Metal Wheel a lot. It is rather oval, and half of its sides consist in a large and very thick slope. Its underside is mostly empty however, which takes away most of its potential weight. </p> 
     <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Core_14">Core</span></h4> 
     <p>This piece looks very similar to its Metal Frame, however there is much less relief in it: while the Metal Frame has slopes, Flash's Core is completely flat. This detail means that its underside is entirely filled though, otherwise it could suffer from breakage issues. </p> 
     <hr /> 
     <ul> 
      <li> <b>Stamina Mode</b></li> 
     </ul> 
     <p>In Stamina Mode, the two bow-and-arrow from the Metal Frame are perpendicular to those of the Core. This mode creates a four-winged shape. </p> 
     <ul> 
      <li> <b>Attack Mode</b></li> 
     </ul> 
     <p>Once the Metal Frame is rotated by 90&deg;, the Attack Mode is achieved, where the two bow-and-arrow designs of the Core are exactly under the Metal Frame's. The resulting shape of the Flash 4D Metal Wheel is one that is exaggerately elongated. However, most of Flash's weight becomes focused on two distinctive sides, which conveys to it a substantial Flywheel Effect, and since both metal parts are one on top of the other, the 4D Metal Wheel becomes much denser. </p> 
     <p>This mode change is possible because of the existence of some small walls on the underside of the Metal Frame. </p>

Two webbed wings also cover the rest of the design, with claws encircling the hole where the orb from the Crystal Wheel gets inserted. The sides of the Dragooon Chrome Wheel are therefore composed of the top of one dragon head, the sides of two other heads, the curved structures of the wings' fingers, and the straight ends of the membrane between them. In general, Dragooon consequently has four sections. </p> 
     <p>Interestingly, Dragooon can be matched in Synchrom with Chrome Wheels that spin in the opposite direction. The combo it is in can only spin left if Dragooon is placed on top of the other Chrome Wheel though, unless another left-spin Chrome Wheel is positioned atop it instead. </p>

     <p>Like all Chrome Wheels, Balro possesses an asymetrical design: at the top is a sculpted horned demon head with an abnormal, star-shaped right eye. Most of the Balro Chrome Wheel's surface is dedicated to huge rigged horns, while the bottom illustrates a carved bat surrounded by flames. The overall structure forms a jagged hexagonal shape. </p>

     <p>Girago is one of the few Chrome Wheels to be mostly symmetrical. Two Chinese dragon heads circle the design, each having a long neck covered by an armor. The heads are in a right-spin direction, and each has a fiery mane. </p>

     <p>Almost completely circular, Wyvang's shape is only disturbed by curved lines coming from the center and, like claws, going down toward the bottom of the Chrome Wheel. At the top is a smooth gathering of long feathers, while the bottom shows a dragon head from the side, which is where a Crystal Wheel's orb would coincidentally protrude to form a big eye. The stickers for this Chrome Wheel give it a scaled body, as is needed to perfect the wyvern theme. </p>

     <p>Like the Big Bang 4D Metal Wheel, the Pegasis Chrome Wheel has three wings, and its design is made of interlaced feathered wings. Three smaller wings form protruding hook-like knots in the design, each placed at equal distances from the others. Two Pegasus heads with their neck circle the inner portion too. The stickers applied on this Chrome Wheel are reminescent of the <a href="javascript:void(0)" title="Phantom Fox MS" onclick="linkclick(this.id)" id="Phantom_Fox_MS.html">Phantom Fox MS</a> HMS Beyblade, notably the blue L-shaped stickers at the top and bottom, as well as the red stickers on the rest of the circumference. </p>

     <p>Bahamdia resembles a reinforced Gargole Chrome Wheel: the demonic head is however positioned at the top of the circumference and the Crystal Wheel's orb protrudes at the bottom, between vague claws. Its relief is created by silky segments forming rounded rectangles as well as few sharp stops indicating horns or wings. This Chrome Wheel's design seems rather inflated at the top compared to the bottom half. </p>
