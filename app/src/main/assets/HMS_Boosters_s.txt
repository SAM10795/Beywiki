Each box would contain a guaranteed prize Beyblade, with the chance of the secret Beyblade instead of the prize Beyblade, along with one of the randomly inserted recolored Beyblade as well. This is why they are often called "Boosters", akin to Random Boosters, but these Fukubako sets are actually Starters and each box includes an HMS Dual Shooter. In total, you will get two Beyblades plus a Launcher.

They are different from a regular starter/booster Beyblade by means of having one of each part inserted at random in them. Each Random Booster Act contains one prize Beyblade and one secret Beyblade in each set. The prize Beyblade (Which has a 1/6 ratio of getting one) is usually a newly released Beyblade that is only containable through the Random Booster Act while the secret Beyblade is a rare recolor of another Beyblade.
