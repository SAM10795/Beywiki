Takao/Tyson isn't a born leader, yet because of his self-confidence, many seem to gravitate toward him. No situation is too risky for Takao/Tyson, and he often relies on nothing more than pure instinct in a Beybattle. His style of playing is aggressive and offensive. In the Japanese version of Beyblade: G-Revolution, Tyson's nickname was &quot;The Champ&quot;. This was seen in Episode 10 at the start of the American arc. </p>

His hair is blue and spikes up and has a ponytail. He wears a red/blue baseball cap backwords. This usually makes his hair spikey. </p>
