SG Sharp - Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization SG Sharp From Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization Contents 1 Beyblades with this part 2 Overall 3 Related Articles Weight: 7 grams This is often considered the successor of the Sharp BB.The pointed tip allows for very little friction between the Beyblade and the Stadium surface which helps maintain high spin velocity. This offers very little movement and as such offers no Attack potential. This part is also often thrown off balance and can be easily toppled over. This in turn sacrifices all Defence ability. While this can be used as an advantage in some situations, there are far better choices than this part for Survival types. Beyblades with this part Death Driger / Shadow Driger Kid Draciel Galman Trypio Master Draciel Manta Driver Rushing Boar Trygle 2 Poseidon Overall This part is severely outclassed when compared to the parts released afterwards. There is absolutely no reason for any Blader to desire to obtain it outside of collection purposes.
