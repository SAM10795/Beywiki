Killer Gemios DF145FS - Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization Killer Gemios DF145FS From Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization Killer Gemios DF145FS Number: BB-56 System: Hybrid Wheel System Type: Balance Contents 1 Name Change 2 Face: Gemios 3 Clear Wheel: Gemios 4 Metal Wheel: Killer 5 Track: Down Force 145 5.1 Use in Stamina Customization 6 Bottom: Flat Sharp 7 Other Versions 8 Gallery 9 Overall Name Change Killer Gemios was renamed Evil Gemios for the Hasbro release. Face: Gemios The Face depicts Gemini, the Twins and is the third astrological sign in the Zodiac. Clear Wheel: Gemios Weight: 2.2 grams Gemios follows the same aesthetic principles as the Gemios Metal Wheel, and Killer, with a similar two-winged design. It is the lightest Clear Wheel available. Metal Wheel: Killer Weight: 31.2 grams Full Width: 45 mm Full Height: 8 mm Wing Distance: 5 mm Like its Metal System predecessor Gemios, Killer has a textured, bumpy, two-winged design that ends in two rounded edges. However, unlike its predecessor, it is considerably thinner even with a smaller amount of metal dropping below the base of the Wheel. Being so thin, the edges of each wing do not apply as much force as those of the Gemios Metal Wheel; as a result, Killer loses any of the potential Smash Attack the first incarnation had. Being so thin negates any possible defensive qualities, and though it may seem suited for Stamina, it peforms poorly compared to other top-tier Stamina Wheels such as Virgo, Burn, and Earth. Track: Down Force 145 Weight: 1.5 grams Full Width: 21.53 mm Height: 14.50 mm DF145 has four upward facing wings protruding from the top of the Track, which aside from giving it extra weight are meant to push air downwards. It is on par with 145 and AD145 in Stamina combinations, however both 85 and 230 are superior and see a more widespread use competitively. Thus, DF145 and other 145 Track-based Stamina customs?which perform poorly against both 85 and 230-based Stamina customs?have been outclassed. Use in Stamina Customization If the aforementioned parts aren't accessible, DF145 can still be put to good use in the custom, Burn Bull DF145SD. Bottom: Flat Sharp Weight: 0.6 gram Full Width: mm Tip Width: mm Full Height: mm Tip Height: mm Sharp Tip Angle: 40° FS features a flat tip with a smaller, sharper tip in the center. As a result, when launched at a straight angle, the Beyblade spins on this sharp tip, with very little movement. However, when tilted, either from the contact of an opposing Beyblade or from the launch, the Bottom moves in an offensive pattern. However, it suffers from the same problems as other Balance Bottoms, in that the two qualities are compromised, resulting in mediocre performance in both fields.
