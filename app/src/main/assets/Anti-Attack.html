     <p><b>Anti-Attack</b> is a specific sub-classification of Beyblade (formally categorized as Balance). Anti-Attack Beyblades, like other Balance type Beyblades, combine two or more of the three standard Beyblade types (<a href="javascript:void(0)" title="Attack" onclick="linkclick(this.id)" id="Attack.html">Attack</a>, <a href="javascript:void(0)" title="Defense" onclick="linkclick(this.id)" id="Defense.html">Defense</a>, and <a href="javascript:void(0)" title="Survival" onclick="linkclick(this.id)" id="Survival.html"> Stamina</a>). Anti-Attack refers to Balance Beyblades that combine <a href="javascript:void(0)" title="Attack" onclick="linkclick(this.id)" id="Attack.html">Attack</a> and <a href="javascript:void(0)" title="Defense" onclick="linkclick(this.id)" id="Defense.html">Defense</a> by utilizing one of the three variants of Rubber Flat (RF, R2F, or LRF), using an aggressive, low-recoil Wheel, and a heavy Track that aids in recoil reduction. </p> 
     <p><br /> These specially selected parts allow Anti-Attack Beyblades to resist KO by opposing Attack combinations and out-spin them, while still retaining enough Smash Attack to easily neutralize competitive Stamina customs. </p> 
     <p><br /> </p> 
     <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Behavior_and_Application_of_an_Anti-Attack_Beyblade">Behavior and Application of an Anti-Attack Beyblade</span></h3> 
     <p>The behavioral attributes of an Anti-Attack custom are: </p> 
     <p><br /> </p> 
     <ul> 
      <li><b>Applicable Smash Attack capable of consistently KOing competitive Stamina combinations</b></li> 
     </ul> 
     <ul> 
      <li><b>Low recoil and overall stability that allows the custom to neutralize Attack combinations</b></li> 
     </ul> 
     <ul> 
      <li><b>Aggressive movement caused by one of the three variants of Rubber Flat</b></li> 
     </ul> 
     <p><br /> These three attributes should be present in <b>all Anti-Attack customs</b>; if any is absent, by definition, the combination in question is not an Anti-Attack Beyblade. </p> 
     <p><br /> Anti-Attack Beyblades are designed to be used against competitive Stamina type Beyblades and competitive Attack type Beyblades. </p> 
     <p><br /> Anti-Attack customizations utilize the aggressiveness of their Wheels and Bottoms to KO Stamina combinations in the same way that conventional Attack types do. The goal against a Stamina type with an Anti-Attack Beyblade is to launch aggressively and aim to KO the opponent as quickly as possible. </p> 
     <p><br /> Against Attack combinations, Anti-Attack customs utilize their heavy weight, bulky setup, stable center of gravity, and high traction and momentum while colliding with an Attack type head-on to effectively absorb the force of impact while taking as little damage as possible. </p> 
     <p><br /> Because the Anti-Attack type is bigger, heavier, and more stable than the Attack type, when the two collide, the Anti-Attack type holds its ground easily and often inflicts devastating rotational damage on the opposing Attack type in the process. </p> 
     <p><br /> Anti-Attack Beyblades should <b>never</b> be used against conventional Defense Beyblades, as their Smash Attack is not on level with pure Attack types, and they lack sufficient Stamina capability to out-spin stationary Defense combinations. </p> 
     <p><br /> </p> 
     <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Composition_of_and_Anti-Attack_Beyblade">Composition of and Anti-Attack Beyblade</span></h3> 
     <p>Anti-Attack Beyblades are composed of: </p> 
     <p><br /> </p> 
     <ul> 
      <li><b>A heavy, aggressive, low recoil Wheel</b></li> 
     </ul> 
     <p><br /> <b>Girago</b> and <b>Diablo</b> are the two best Wheels for Anti-Attack Beyblades to use, but <b>Saramanda</b> and <b>Begirados</b> can be used as substitutes if they are not available. </p> 
     <p><br /> </p> 
     <ul> 
      <li><b>A heavy Track that aids in recoil reduction</b></li> 
     </ul> 
     <p><br /> <b>BD145</b> is essentially the only currently competitive Track for Anti-Attack, but if it is absent, <b>SA165</b> can be used in its place. </p> 
     <p><br /> </p> 
     <ul> 
      <li><b>One of the three variants of Rubber Flat</b> </li> 
     </ul> 
     <p><br /> They should also include a Metal (Stone) Face if one is available. </p> 
     <p><br /> Some good examples of applicable Anti-Attack type Beyblades are: </p> 
     <p><br /> </p> 
     <ul> 
      <li><b>MSF-L Girago Girago BD145RF</b></li> 
      <li><b>MF-H Diablo Unicorno II BD145LRF</b></li> 
      <li><b>MSF-H Begirados Begirados BD145R2F</b></li> 
     </ul> 
     <p><br /> </p> 
     <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Distinguishing_an_Anti-Attack_Beyblade_From_Other_Similar_Forms_of_Customization">Distinguishing an Anti-Attack Beyblade From Other Similar Forms of Customization</span></h3> 
     <p>Anti-Attack Beyblades should not be confused with <b>aggressive Defense Beyblades</b> (which, unlike Anti-Attack Beyblades, do not employ aggressive Wheels and have no competitive use against Stamina Beyblades), or with <b>conventional Attack/Defense Hybrids</b> (which, unlike Anti-Attack Beyblades, do not utilize one of the three variants of Rubber Flat). Making This distinction is important. </p> 
     <p><br /> The following examples illustrate the differences between Anti-Attack Beyblades and other similar forms of customization. </p> 
     <p><br /> </p> 
     <ul> 
      <li><b>MSF-H Genbull Genbull BD145RF</b> (aggressive Defense) is <i>not</i> an Anti-Attack Beyblade. While it still utilizes one of the three variants of Rubber Flat and serves to neutralize Attack types much like an Anti-Attack Beyblade, it does not use an aggressive Wheel and performs poorly against Stamina Beyblades.</li> 
     </ul> 
     <p><br /> </p> 
     <ul> 
      <li><b>MSF-H Wyvang Wyvang BD145RDF</b> (conventional Attack/Defense Hybrid) is <i>not</i> an Anti-Attack Beyblade. It does combine traits from both Attack and Defense Beyblades to form a combination that can both Defend sufficiently and subdue Stamina customs via KO, but, unlike an Anti-Attack Beyblade, it does not use one of the three Rubber Flat Bottoms.</li> 
     </ul> 
     <p><br /> </p> 
     <ul> 
      <li><b>MSF-L Girago Girago BD145RF</b> <i>is</i> an Anti-Attack Beyblade. It utilizes one of the threed variants of Rubber Flat, uses an aggressive, low recoil Wheel, and a bulky setup that allows it to take hits well from Attack types and easily KO competitive Stamina combinations at the same time.</li> 
     </ul> 
     <p><br /> These customizations have different applications. Agressive Defense should be used for a purely defensive approach. Conventional Attack/Defense Hybrids more or less target the same combinations that Anti-Attack Beyblades do, but there behavior is diferent; they move with less aggression, and are generally easier to use (although they sacrifice some level of Defense for this). Anti-Attack Beyblades target Stamina and Attack customs, like conventional Attack/Defense Hybrids, but they are more specialized against Attack customizations and usually require a higher level of launching skill to use properly. </p>
