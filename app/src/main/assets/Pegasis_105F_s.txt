Pegasis 105F - Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization Pegasis 105F From Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization Pegasis 105F (Flat) Number: BB-01 System: Metal Fight Beyblade Type: Attack Contents 1 Face 2 Wheel: Pegasis 2.1 Design Change 3 Track: 105 4 Bottom: Flat 5 Other Versions 6 Gallery 6.1 Pegasis 105F (original release) 6.2 MF-H Pegasis 85RF - Beyblade Super Deck Set 7 Overall Pegasis 105F is one of the first four Metal Fight Beyblades released, and it is part of the Horoscope Series along with Leone, Bull, and Sagittario. Face The Face on this Beyblade depicts Pegasus, one of the 88 constellations in space. Wheel: Pegasis Weight: 36 grams Full Width: 43.5 to 44.0 mm Highest discontinued point: 13.0 mm Maximum Height: 9.7 mm Minimum Height: 6.5 mm Upward Declination: ~ 28° Pegasis consists of a three-winged design. Each of the three sections has a flat front that connects the protrusions. The segments slightly curve upwards in the shape of wings, with two pointed ridges near the end. Hoove-like parts can also be observed in the design. This Wheel is one of the best Smash Attack Wheels from the Metal System series. Surprisingly however, its potential was not realized by the community until much later. After the Metal System had already ended, MF Pegasis 145RF was eventually popularized due to its high success rate against WB-tipped Defense combos, which were top-tier at the time. In combination with MF and RF, the Recoil Pegasis did experience was minimized, which allowed for its powerful Smash Attack to KO opponents with ease, especially Stamina types. However, when rubber-based Defense became a reality with Bottoms such as RS, Pegasis, and other popular right-spin Attack Wheels of the time (such as Storm, Ray, and Sagittario) were unable to contend with the strong grip those Bottoms provided and, as a result, fell into disuse. Design Change Pegasis 145D Prototype The original design of Pegasis (pictured to the right) was changed to the current design sometime before the launch of Metal Fight Beyblade. No official statement was made, but the Beyblade community has speculated that it was due to probable breakage problems with each of the three highly exposed "wings" on the Wheel. Track: 105 Weight: 1 gram Width with Handles: 22.0 mm Maximum Width: 18.0 mm Minimum Width: 16.0 mm Core Cylinder Diameter: 11.0 mm Full Height: 10.50 mm This Track is currently the fourth lowest Track available, but is outclassed in terms of Attack and Stamina by the 85, 90, and 100 Tracks. 105 has no problem with floor scrapes, but still is an outclassed part and should only be chosen when none of the aforementioned Tracks are available. Bottom: Flat Weight: 1 gram Full Width: 15.92 mm Tip Width: 4.08 mm Full Height: 8.96 mm Tip Height: 5.96 mm The Flat Bottom has a plastic flat tip, which gives it an offensive movement pattern. It is the equivalent of Flat Core (HMS) or SG Flat (Plastic). The F Bottom has a hard time retaining a flower pattern, due to it being plastic, which results in it having less grip to the stadium floor than a rubber bottom. F has been overshadowed by countless other Attack Bottoms such as XF, MF, RF, and R²F.

Additionally, both 105 and F have generally been overshadowed by newer parts like 85/90/100 and RF/R²F, which leaves very little reason to purchase Pegasis 105F currently. Therefore, there is little to no reason to purchase this Beyblade outside of collection reasons. Retrieved from " http://wiki.worldbeyblade.org/index.php?title=Pegasis_105F&oldid=13373"
