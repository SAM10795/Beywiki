Thermal Lacerta WA130HF - Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization Thermal Lacerta WA130HF From Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization Thermal Lacerta WA130HF Number: BB-74 System: Hybrid Wheel System Type: Balance Contents 1 Face: Lacerta 2 Clear Wheel: Lacerta 3 Metal Wheel: Thermal 3.1 Use in Stamina customization 4 Track: Wing Attacker 130 5 Bottom: Hole Flat 6 Other Versions 7 Gallery 7.1 Thermal Lacerta WA130HF (regular) 7.2 Thermal Lacerta WA130HF (red) 8 Overall Face: Lacerta The Face on this beyblade depicts Lacerta, the Lizard, one of the 88 constellation in space. The pattern on the Lizard's back, when read from head to tail, reads "LACERTA" in a stylised font. Clear Wheel: Lacerta Weight: 2.8 grams The Lacerta Clear Wheel is translucent bright pink-red in colour and takes the form of two lizards. The back half of each lizard is interrupted by clumps of blue painted squiggles which spell out "LACERTA" in a stylised font. Metal Wheel: Thermal Weight: 30.5 grams The Thermal Metal Wheel consists of two large wings which are pointed at their respective beginnings and ends. Thermal is largely based on the Metal System Pisces, and as such, the three notches on the Wheel are representative of a shark's gills. Although it has relatively sharp contact points, they do not protrude far out enough to provide any significant Smash Attack. The Wheel does possess moderate Stamina capabilities due to its relatively round shape, but is considered outclassed for this purpose by Earth, Burn, Scythe, Basalt and Hell. Use in Stamina customization Thermal can be put to good use in the Stamina customization Thermal Aquario 105WD, though, still severely outclassed by more recent stamina wheels/combinations. Track: Wing Attacker 130 Weight: 2.2 grams Full Width: 39.17 mm Minimum Width: 25.21 mm Full Height: 13.00 mm WA130 is a 130-height Track with two aerofoil-shaped wings that rotate freely around the Track. By removing this piece, and flipping it over, the direction of the wings can be changed. These wings are negligible in battle: while they offer minor protection against lower Attack-Type opponents, there are better Tracks for this purpose. As the wings can scrape along the stadium floor, causing a loss of spin, WA130 is useless in Stamina combinations. The main appeal of this Track is its height. The 130 height has proven useful in certain Attack customisations. However, as it cannot make contact with lower opponents due to its free-spinning nature, it is considered less useful for this purpose than S130. In addition, the most popular user of this height, Fang, already comes with a plain 130 Track in its only release, Fang Leone 130W²D. As WA130 offers little advantage over 130, it is not considered a worthwhile purchase. Bottom: Hole Flat Weight: 0.5 gram Full Width: 15.95 mm Tip Width: 4.01 mm Hole Diameter: 2.27 mm Full Height: 8.96 mm Tip Height: 6.02 mm HF has a very similar movement speed to that of F, with the main difference being a slight Stamina improvement due to the hole in the middle of the Tip. But, with this comes the detriment of even less grip to the stadium floor than F, and also increased fragility.
