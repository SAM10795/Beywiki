Beyblade Super Deck Set - Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization Beyblade Super Deck Set From Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization Beyblade Super Deck Set Number: BB-96 System: Metal Fight Beyblade Contents 1 Contents 2 Overall 3 Gallery Contents MF-H Pegasis 85RF Libra 100D MF-F Burn Cancer 90WD Overall The Beyblade Super Deck Set's purpose was to release combos that frequently placed among TAKARA-TOMY tournaments at the time of release. As such, it contains all re-released parts, but also allows an easier way to find relatively rare, competitive parts; most importantly, Libra. However, as great as the set was when it was released, not long after release, the Wheels all became outclassed?Pegasis by Wheels like Beat, and Libra/Burn by Basalt?with the advent of the Maximum Series and everything that followed in the 4D System. That said, this set does still contain numerous parts that have remained at least somewhat competitive to this day; like MF-H, 85, RF, 100, D, 90, and WD. The Beyblade Super Deck Set is readily available, and the variety of useful parts do make it a worthwhile purchase if you need them all, but for any Blader getting started with competitive battling, there are newer sets available (like the Strongest Blader Set or Beyblade Ultimate DX Set) which provide a better base to build from.
