In theory, such a low Track would offer many advantages; Attack-Types can more easily hit the underside of Metal Wheels, or hit directly at the Tracks and Bottoms, while Defense and Stamina benefits from a lower center of gravity, as well as reducing the chances of meaningful hits. The main disadvantage consists of increased chances of scraping on the Stadium floor. Competitively however, Low Track customizations have fallen into disuse with the release of the Boost Disk 145 and 230 Tracks. The former (in Normal Mode) is basically immune to Low Track Attack, while the latter, being made of plastic and being so circular, is much more effective at absorbing hits and prevents opponents from latching onto it. Additionally, in the case of Attack customizations, 85 can be a slightly risky choice, as it increases your chances of scraping while attempting to bank or use the Sliding Shoot; as such, Tracks like 100 or 90 may be preferred depending on how much a (Metal) Wheel overhangs its Track. Beyblade: Mercury Anubius 85XF, Omega Dragonis 85XF, MF-H Pegasis 85RF, Meteo L-Drago 85XF Assault Ver., Gravity Perseus (Stamina Version)85DS, Hell Horuseus 85RS, Cloud Lyra 85SF, Meteo L-Drago (Rush Version)85LF 90 Weight: 0.9 gram Full Width: 21.0 mm Height: 9.00 mm 90 90 was the lowest Track until the release of 85 with Mercury Anubis. Its low height is good for both low Attack customizations and low Stamina customizations, but is outclassed slightly in both regards by the aforementioned 85. Beyblade: Quetzalcoatl 90WF, Bakushin Susanow 90WF, MF-F Burn Cancer 90WD, Screw Capricorne 90MF, Divine Fox 90W²D, Wing Pegasis 90WF 100 100 Track Weight: 1.0 grams This track is currently the third lowest track available, but is outclassed in terms of Attack and Stamina by the 85 and 90 Tracks. 100 usually has no problem with floor scrapes, and while it is generally an outclassed part, is still competitively viable, particularly in Attack customizations where it is able to make good contact with most opposing Beyblades. Beyblade: Capricorne 100HF, Libra 100F, Heat Pegasis 100WB, Wind Aquario 100HF/S, Lightning L Drago 100HF, Cyber Pegasis 100HF, Wind Sagittario 100SD, Libra 100D, Rock Libra 100WD, Killer Escolpio 100D, Burn Escolpio 100RF, Ray Gil 100RSF, Hell Herculeo 100XF, Blitz Unicorno 100RSF 105 105 Track Weight: 1.0 grams This track is currently the fourth lowest track available, but is outclassed in terms of Attack and Stamina by the 85, 90, and 100 Tracks. 105 has no problem with floor scrapes, but still is an outclassed part and should only be chosen when none of the aforementioned Tracks are available. Beyblade: Pegasis 105F, Leone 105F, Wolf 105F, Bull 105S, Bull 105D, Aquario 105F, L Drago 105F, Aquario 105B, Storm Pegasis 105RF, Clay Wolf 105B, Flame Bull 105WB, Tornado Heracleo 105F, Flame Gemios 105CS, Burn Sagittario 105HF, Hyper Aquario 105F DF105: Downforce 105 Beyblade: L-Drago Destroy DF105LRF Gold Armored Ver., Beyblade Ultimate DX Set LW105: Left Wing 105 Beyblade: Meteo L-Drago LW105LF, Meteo L-Drago (Assault Version) LW105JB W105: Wing 105 W105 Weight: 1.2 grams Wing 105, or W105, consists of two curved wing-like fins that slant downwards, similar to DF145. The main purpose of this Track is to push air upwards to provide extra Stamina, but the effect this Track produces is negligible, therefore it has as much competitive value as a regular 105 track. W105 should only be used in the absence of 85, 90, and 100 in both Stamina and Attack customizations. Beyblade: Galaxy Pegasis W105R²F, Samurai Pegasis W105R²F CH120: Change 120 Weight: 2.7 gram Full Width: 27.3 mm Minimum Width: 23.0 mm Height: 12.0 to 14.5 mm Mechanism Height: 5.0 mm CH120 CH120 is unique as it features a height-changing gimmick. The user is allowed a choice of using 120 or 145 as the Track's height. This is done by rotating the bottom portion of the Track and pulling/pushing the central part out/in, and then rotating the bottom portion back to lock the height. Importantly, this can be done between each round of a match, as it does not involve any part-swapping. The advantages of this Track are plentiful. Its most obvious benefit is allowing the user to change the height of their Beyblade between rounds; this means that the user can adapt their strategy to counter the opponents during a match. CH120 is currently the only Track featuring a 120 height. This height is useful for many Attack types. Beyblade: Mad Cancer CH120FS, Dark Cancer CH120SF, Dark Cancer CH120FS 125 Weight: 1.0 grams 125 The 125 Track is a midway between the 105 and the 145 Tracks. Utilised in mid-height stamina combos, it is more difficult to destablise compared to 145 height stamina combos. It has declined in popularity as the choice mid-height track due to the release of T125 and D125. Beyblade: Bull 125SF, Sagittario 125SF, Aries 125D, Leone 125S, Virgo 125BS, Death Quetzalcoatl 125RDF, Hell Beelzeb 125XF, Crash Escolpio 125JB D125: Defense 125 Weight: 1.7 gram Full Width: 26.5 mm Core Width: 11 mm Full Height: 12.50 mm D125 Defense 125 is similar to 125 and T125. Apart from the shifts in weight distribution and air resistance, there are few notable differences. The ring serves no significant defensive purposes. D125 is an outclassed track for Stamina and Defense customizations. It can be used in some Attack customizations. Beyblade: Wolf D125B, Pisces D125BS, Libra D125HF, Wind Leone D125HF, Heat Leone D125FS, Heat Bull D125WB, Rock Orso D125B, Counter Leone D125B, Ray Unicorno D125CS, Flame Cancer D125RF, Galaxy Cancer D125HF T125: Tornado 125 T125 Weight: 1.7 gram Full Width: 24.5 mm Minimum Width: 17 mm Full Height: 12.50 mm T125 has four upward-facing wing protrusions spaced apart widely. The Track is designed to work in a similar way to DF145, although the effect it produces is negligible. The performance of this Track is similar to D125. It is used in some Attack and Stamina customizations. Beyblade: Flame Libra T125ES, Rock Capricorne T125D, Flame Capricorne T125HF, Thermal Pisces T125ES, Rock Escolpio T125JB, Grand Ketos T125RS, Storm Serpent T125HF, Scythe Kronos T125EDS, Cloud Gemios T125SF, Bakushin Beelzeb T125XF, Pirates Ifraid T125GCF, Pirates Saramanda T125WB 130 Beyblade: Poison Unicorno 130HF, Storm Phoenix 130B, Fang Leone 130W²D, Vulcan Herculeo 130DS, Tornado Horuseus 130RSF, Forbidden Eonis 130D, Hell Crown 130FB, MF-H Basalt Horogium 130RS S130: Shield 130 S130 Weight: 3.3 grams Maximum Width: 35.5 mm Minimum Width: 33.0 mm Full Height: 13.00 mm Arc between protrusions: 8.0 mm Made only of plastic, S130 has a horizontal disk attached to its centre. This disk actually consists of eight arms linked by some relatively round webs of plastic, which overall forms an imperfect circle Beyblade: Poison Giraffe S130MB, Jade Jupiter S130RB, L-Drago Guardian S130MB, Wing Pegasis S130RB World Congress Commemorative Model WA130: Wing Attacker 130 WA130 Weight: 2.2 grams Full Width: 39.17 mm Minimum Width: 25.21 mm Full Height: 13.00 mm WA130 is a 130-height Track with two aerofoil-shaped wings that rotate freely around the Track. By removing this piece, and flipping it over, the direction of the wings can be changed. These wings are negligible in battle: while they offer minor protection against lower Attack-Type opponents, there are better Tracks for this purpose. As the wings can scrape along the stadium floor, causing a loss of spin, WA130 is useless in Stamina combinations. The main appeal of this Track is its height. The 130 height has proven useful in certain Attack customisations. However, as it cannot make contact with lower opponents due to its free-spinning nature, it is considered less useful for this purpose than S130. In addition, the most popular user of this height, Fang, already comes with a plain 130 Track in its only release, Fang Leone 130W²D. As WA130 offers little advantage over 130, it is not considered a worthwhile purchase. Beyblade: Thermal Lacerta WA130HF, Burn Serpent WA130ES, Poison Phoenix WA130SD 135 Weight: 1.40 grams 135 is the only Track released at this height and features no gimmick. Due to its odd height, it is rarely considered over the taller 145 Tracks and the shorter 120 and 125 Tracks, because it is usually preferred if customizations are either tall, either short, not in between. Average height produces only average effect, a poor mix of what a Metal Wheel can do at short and tall heights. Beyblade: Burn Phoenix 135MS 145 145 Weight: 1.47 grams Full Width: 20 mm Minimum Width: 18 mm Height: 14.50 mm This track is a regular, non-gimmicked track at the 145 height. It can be used in Stamina customs to great effect to to its tall height, but has been outclassed for wobbler customs by 230. It used to be on par for Stamina customs with DF145, but AD145 offers better Stamina on a 145 height, and 85 offers better Stamina in general. Beyblade:Sagittario 145S, Leone 145D, Pegasis 145D, Pegasis 145F, Pegasis 145SF, Sagittario 145SF, Sagittario 145D, Rock Leone 145WB, Mad Leone 145B, Clay Wolf 145FS, Clay Sagittario 145B, Mad Leone 145FS, Storm Sagittario 145SD, Clay Pegasis 145S, Earth Aquila 145WD, Storm Aquila 145HF, Storm Libra 145S, Aries 145D, Galaxy Sagittario 145CS, Vulcan Horuseus 145D, Basalt Horogium 145WD, Kreis Cygnus 145WD, Pirates Orojya 145D, Shinobi Orojya 145ES, Samurai Orojya 145WD AD145: Armor Defense 145 AD145 Weight: 2.8 grams Full Width: 28 mm Full Height: 14.50 mm Declination Angle: ~ 32° AD145 is shaped like the head of a funnel, completely round with ridges lining the sides all the way around. In fact, its shape is intended to resemble that of an armor, hence its name. Despite what the latter part of its name might suggest though, Tracks such as 230 and GB145 outclass AD145 as a defensive Track due to its relatively light weight in comparison to GB145 and its diminutive stature when compared to 230, which makes it unable it to absorb hits as 230 does. With the introduction of BD145, this Track has definitely been surpassed in Defense. However, AD145 has actually proved to be better suited for Stamina in certain cases, due to the outward weight distribution it has compared to other top tier Stamina Tracks, thus making it top-tier in this area. It is also the Track of choice for comparative Stamina testing. Beyblade: Gravity Perseus AD145WD, Fusion Hades AD145SWD BD145: Boost Disk 145 BD145: Normal Mode BD145: Boost Mode Weight: 8 grams Full Width: 48.3 mm Full Height: 14.50 mm Vertical Protrusions Height: 7.8 mm Disk Height: 4.0 mm BD145 shares a similar trait with its partner Hell, in that, like Hell is one of the widest Metal Wheels ever released, BD145 is the widest Track ever. This Track is unique both because of its width and also its ability to change modes. Changing modes is similar to how it is done with SW145, however this time, instead of removing the changeable part from the bottom and flipping it, it is removed from the top and then flipped. BD145 has two modes: Normal Mode In Normal Mode the "Boost Disk" sits lower on the Track, which causes most Beyblades to scrape the Beystadium floor easily due to the three downward facing protrusions. However, when using a taller Bottom such as RF, this tendency is lessened somewhat, and the wide diameter of BD145, while it is not able to necessarily provide Smash Attack, it assists in "pushing" the opposing Beyblade out of the Beystadium. Boost Mode Boost Mode works exclusively in combination with Hell. The three upward facing protrusions on BD145 go past the bottom of the Metal Wheel into the gaps of Hell itself and unlike Normal Mode, there is absolutely no space between the Metal Wheel and Boost Disk. This mode has proven to be incredibly effective in Stamina, Defense, and even Attack customizations. Beyblade: Hell Kerbecs BD145DS, Gravity Perseus (Attack Version)BD145XF, Vulcan Horogium BD145RS C145: Claw 145 C145 Weight: 3.2 grams Maximum Width: 34.0 mm Minimum Width: 27.0 mm Full Height: 14.50 mm Claws & Platform Height: 7.8 mm C145 has three wings which extend outwards, each separately joined onto the underside of the Track. These are free moving, and hence when the Beyblade is launched, these point outwards due to spin velocity. Their free moving nature make them very effective for defensive purposes, as they are able to withstand low hits to the Track without significant spin loss. Although C145 was a good Defense track at the time of its release, it has since then been outclassed by GB145, 230, and BD145. Beyblade: Flame Sagittario C145S, Dark Leone C145B, Mad Sagittario C145SD, Mad Bull C145HF DF145: Down Force 145 DF145 Weight: 1.5 grams Full Width: 21.53 mm Height: 14.50 mm DF145 has four upward facing wings protruding from the top of the Track, which aside from giving it extra weight are meant to push air downwards. It is now outclassed for use in Stamina combinations. Instead, tracks such as AD145, 145, 100, 90, and even 85 are used. Beyblade: Libra DF145BS, Virgo DF145BS, Aquario DF145SF, Gemios DF145FS, Dark Wolf DF145FS, Wind Pegasis DF145FS, Clay Leone DF145WB, Heat Pegasis DF145WB, Mad Sagittario DF145HF, Earth Cancer DF145ES, Killer Gemios DF145FS, Pisces DF145BS, Saramanda Ifraid DF145XF Burst Flame Ver. ED145: Eternal Defense 145 Weight: 3.6 gram Full Width: 39.5 mm Wing Width: 23.0 mm Wing Distance: 13.5 mm Full Height: 14.50 mm ED145 ED145 features three ?wings? which rotate around the Track freely. The wings are similar to that of WD145. Because of their free-spinning nature, they can be used in Defense customisations, such as MF Libra ED145WB; however, the defensive capabilities of this part are not as effective as C145, as it does not absorb hits as successfully. The wings which rotate are hindered without the mechanism of a bearing, hence creating a force of friction between the wings and the body of the Track, in turn resulting in less significant damage absorption. Furthermore, it is easy for the low attacker?s Wheel to be caught between the Wheel and ED145, hence causing a lot of recoil and spin reduction to the Defense customization. Beyblade: Clay Aries ED145B, Forbidden Eonis ED145FB, Screw Lyra ED145MF GB145: Gravity Bowl 145 GB145 Weight: 4.5 grams Maximum Width: 36.0 mm Minimum Width: 28.5.0 mm Full Height: 14.50 mm Metal Balls Diameter: 5.0 mm GB145 is a wide, round track featuring two free moving metal balls. These balls move toward the outside of the Track while spinning, causing additional spin retaining force, similar to Draciel Metal Ball Defenser's Metal Ball Base from the plastic generation. Weighing in at 4.5 grams, GB145 is currently one of the heaviest Tracks available, and as such is useful in Defense customizations. At release, it was seen by some as inferior to C145 due to the lack of energy-absorbing free spinning wings, making it not as effective as against low attackers such as Quetzalcoatl 90RF, which were popular at the time. Where GB145 does shine is when it is utilized in Defense customizations against high CH120-based Attackers, such as MF Lightning L Drago CH120RF. These types of Attackers do not aim to hit the Track, and thus the free spinning wings of C145 are not necessary, and you instead get a significant increase in the overall weight of the customization. However, it has been outclassed for Defense customizations by BD145 and TH170. Beyblade: Earth Virgo GB145BS, Infinity Libra GB145S, Galaxy Pegasis GB145MS Black Hole Ver. H145: Horn 145 (First Mold) H145 (First Mold) Weight: 4 grams H145 has two wings with two various protrusions, representing the horns of a Bull surrounding its perimeter. These four points are meant to provide Smash Attack, and they do succeed on some levels. However, because the horns are so pronounced, and because the gaps between the wings are so wide, significant recoil is produced, especially when used in combination with small Metal Wheels that allow the Horns to extend well past the perimeter of the Wheel. While H145 may not be an entirely noteworthy part as far as competitive customizations go, it is still quite a fun part to play with. You can score many impressive KO's with the recoil it produces in the first few seconds of a battle, but at the same time, this recoil does work against you in some battles, causing a self-KO or if not, a severe loss of Stamina. Beyblade: Dark Bull H145SD H145: Horn 145 (Second Mold) H145 (Second Mold) Weight: 4.3 grams H145 has two different molds. The first version's wings were not reinforced in anyway, so they were prone to breakages in some cases. The second mold which was brought into production a couple months after it was originally released rectified this problem by reinforcing the wings with a significant amount of plastic between the inside of the wings and the outside of the Track. This increased the weight of the Track to 4.3 grams, only .2 grams lighter than the second heaviest Track, GB145. The increased weight not only reduces breakages, but it also marginally helps reduce the recoil it produces. Beyblade: Dark Bull H145SD, Flame Wolf H145S, Rock Wolf H145B, Wind Wolf H145D, Heat Leone H145S M145: Move 145 Weight: 4.2 gram Full Width: 27.0 mm Full Height: 14.50 mm M145 is a round Track, with a mode change gimmick. The connectors which the Bottom attach to can be moved into two different modes, designated as Large Jump and Small Jump. When the connectors are manually moved to the Large Jump position, the connectors are located off center. The Bottom is therefore off center, and the Beyblade moves erratically, and will bounce up and down on the Stadium floor. In the Small Jump position, the connectors are still slightly off center, but less so than Large Jump mode. In this position, the Beyblade will not jump nearly as much; instead, it will move with far more regularity. M145 bounces most vigorously when used with Sharp series Bottoms, such as Sharp and Ball Sharp. It's also the first part in the whole Beyblade toyline to have a real, effective jumping gimmick, regardless of how useful it is. This Track's gimmick is seen as purely for entertainment and interest; it has yet to be used in any competitive customizations, as it is too unpredictable. When the Beyblade is temporarily in the air when it is bouncing, it is extremely easy to KO, as its friction with the floor is zero. Beyblades using this Track also suffer from extremely low Stamina, as the off center Bottom disrupts the rotation severely. TAKARA-TOMY's M145 is reportedly less solid in its mode change than Hasbro's. The connectors, upon considerable and punctual impact, can slide into their other position on their own, which is against the nature of the Track's gimmick. Beyblade: Storm Capricorne M145Q, Pirates Revizer M145CF, Guardian Gargole M145SB R145: Rubber 145 R145 Weight: 4.7 grams R145 consists of three wings similar in shape to WD145, but instead the wings are made of a hard rubber. The concept behind the track was to deflect lower attackers and absorb impact. However, it suffers the same problems that WD145 does, in that it's possible for the attacker's Wheel to be caught in between the Wheel and R145, causing recoil and spin reduction in the process. For this reason, R145 is outclassed as a Defense Track by other options such as GB145, BD145, and 230. While outclassed in Defense customizations, R145 has found use in Attack customizations due to its three wing shape and fairly heavy weight compared to most tracks, which helps to reduce recoil. Beyblade : Rock Giraffe R145WB SW145: Switch 145 SW145 Weight: 4.2 gram Maximum Width: 38 mm Minimum Width: 30.5 mm Wings Height: 2 mm Height: 14.50 mm SW145 has three 'wings'. The gimmick of this Track is the ability to change from Attack to Defense by taking off the wings, and then putting them on the opposite way. The purpose of this is the ability to adapt to opponent Beys. In Attack mode, which is denoted by six grey claw-like stickers on the underside, the pointed ends of the Track are used for Smash Attack; meanwhile in Defense mode, shown by three triangular blue stickers, the edges are more rounded, in order to deflect opponent Beys. The modes are reversed for Left-Spin Beys. Testing has shown that SW145 is quite useful at attacking lower opponents in a similar fashion to H145 and R145. It is however outclassed for Defense purposes by GB145, BD145, and 230 due to the recoil it produces. Beyblades: Poison Serpent SW145SD, Nightmare Rex SW145SD, Burn Unicorno SW145JB, Shinobi Saramanda SW145SD TR145: Triple Roller 145 Beyblade: Divine Chimera TR145FB, Divine Crown TR145D, Screw Fox TR145W²D UW145: Upper Wing 145 Beyblade: Killer Beafowl UW145EWD, MF-F Nightmare Rex UW145EWD V145: Variable 145 Weight: 3.6 grams Variable 145 (V145) is made of two parts. One part, a little changing plate can be used to change Sol Blaze into two different modes, "Attack" and "Defense". Variable 145 is outclassed by other Defense Tracks such as 230, TH170, TR145, C145, and UW145. However, it still outclasses Tracks like SW145, WD145, D125, and AD145. Beyblade: Sol Blaze V145AS W145: Wing 145 Weight: 2.2 grams W145 is a normal 145 Track with six sharp wings that are slightly angled. The pointy ends are however cut off to form, overall, more of a dodecagon. It is based off of W105, T125, and DF145, and likely produces a negligible downforce effect. Beyblade: Samurai Ifraid W145CF, Guardian Saramanda W145Q, Archer Ifraid W145SB WD145: Wide Defense 145 WD145 Weight: 3.6 gram Full Width: 38 mm Wing Width: 23.5 mm Wing Distance: 13.5 mm Height: 14.50 mm WD145 features three ?wings?. The wings are similar to that of ED145, the only difference being that its wings cannot spin freely. The defensive capabilities of this part are outclassed in all areas by other Defensive Tracks, such as C145, GB145, and 230, as it does not absorb hits as successfully. Furthermore, it is easy for the low attacker?s Wheel to be caught between the Wheel and WD145, causing a lot of recoil and spin reduction in the process. Beyblades: Escolpio WD145B, Grand Ketos T125/WD145RS 160 Weight: grams Unlike the majority of the non-gimmick Tracks, 160 resembles 230 more than 145, with a round and large body around its hexagon-shaped core. This construction is probably meant to strengthen it, since chances of getting hit are relatively low compared to 230, and the stair-like design would have become too slim at this height. Beyblade: Guardian Revizer 160SB, Pirates Gryph 160CF, Shinobi Orojya 160WSF LW160: Left Wing 160 LW160 Weight: 2.36 grams The LW160 Track is in most aspects entirely identical to W145, however the wings face the left, and its height is different. Beyblade: Dark Knight Dragooon LW160BSF SA165: Switch Attack 165 Weight: 6.18 grams Reminiscent of Armor 145, SA165 also has a wide, parabolic shape around its core which is completely hollow except for the rigid sides forming the parabola. This latter piece can be removed, flipped, and inserted back on the core of the Track to build another mode which is more likely to touch the stadium floor, especially in Zero-G Stadiums. The parabolic part is not perfectly smooth however, as it has linear ridges going towards the core, and its outermost circumference is full of small spikes, much like GCF. Its diameter is considerable though. Beyblade: Archer Gargole SA165WSF, Samurai Revizer SA165Q, Gargole Ifraid SA165GCF TH170: Triple Height 170 TH170 Weight 4.39 grams TH170 contains a height-changing Track similar to CH120; it can change between 170, 195, and 220. And unlike CH120, TH170 has no mechanical problems that cause it to change height mid-battle, like many CH120's do. TH170 is infinitely more versatile than 230 because of its height change ability. While 230 is easily KOed by 145-height Attack customizations due to its height, TH170 can stand up against them if necessary with the two lower heights it can change down to: 170 and 195. And it can also fare well against low-Track Attack customizations just as well as 230 can when used at the 220-height. Although, it should be noted that due to the height change mechanism of the Track, the design of TH170 is not as funnel-like and smooth as 230's is. As a result, low-Track Attackers could possibly garner more success against TH170 at the 220-height than they would against 230. This is simply one minor caveat though; TH170's outstanding ability to adapt to countless situations more than makes up for it. In general, the 170 and 195 heights are best used against 145-height Attack and Stamina combinations, while the 220 height is best used for outspinning 230-height Stamina customs, as well as low-track Attack, Defense, and Stamina combinations. Beyblade: Beat Lynx TH170WD SR200: Stamina Ring 200 Weight: 3.3 gram Full Width: 26.5 mm Core Width: 10.0 mm Height: 20.00 mm Similar to D125, SR200 possesses a wide and lengthy stamina ring around its core. This ring, while circular around the center, is completely straight vertically. Beyblade: Berserker Begirados SR200BWD 230 230 230 vs. 85 Weight: 4.1 grams Maximum Width: 23.0 mm Minimum Width: 17.0 mm Full Height: 23.0 mm 230 is the tallest Track released thus far. 230 is part of the Maximum Series, and is labeled as the Maximum Height for Tracks. 230 has six indents near the top of the Track that sharpen downwards to about the half of the Track. 230 is rounder and thicker than regular Tracks with no gimmicks in order to protect it structurally as it comes into regular contact with opposing Wheels. Its round and smooth shape results in significantly less recoil than if it were based on the traditional hexagonal Track shape. Since 230 is so tall, it can wobble at great lengths for extra Stamina, defeating various Stamina customizations with lower Tracks. From a defensive viewpoint, it uses its height as an advantage to protect itself from low incoming Attacks, by protecting the Metal Wheel from major contact while using the reinforced plastic to absorb most of the shock. As a result of this, 230 can defeat most low Attack customizations under the 120 height when paired with other top-tier Defense parts. 230 also has some notable weaknesses, however. As a Defense Track, 230 is extremely susceptible to tall Track Attack types in the opposite spin direction such as MF Lightning L Drago BD145LRF and MF Gravity Perseus BD145RF. Additionally, TH170 at 220 height is successful against 230-based customizations, while also offering height-based versatility at the same time. This play of good defense against low Beyblades and weakness against high Attackers is highly due to the fact that low tops hit it exactly in its center of gravity. Most of the weight is obviously at the top of the Beyblade using 230, however the Track itself also possess a considerable mass, and the sum of those weights brings the center of gravity exactly around where 120-based Beyblades attack. Usually, the lower the center of gravity, the better, but as long as it is targeted, the object retains a certain balance. If it gets hit away from that center of gravity vertically, then the object will lose its stability, which is what happens with 230. Beyblade: Flame Byxis 230WD, Duo Uranus 230WD, Flash Sagittario 230WD, Thief Saramanda 230WB, Shinobi Ifraid 230WD E230: Elevator 230 Weight: 7.4 gram Full Width: 48.0 mm Distance from Bottom: 6 mm Boost Mode Distance from Bottom: 8 mm Height: 23.00 mm E230 is a mechanical upgrade to the regular 230 Track. Its core is modified to accomodate, along its whole height, the ascent and descent of a free-moving disk, hence the term "elevator". This disk however does not freely-rotate around the Track like ED145, and its vertical position cannot be fixed. E230 works almost essentially for the Zero-G Stadiums, because its gimmick requires a lot of movements up and down to function well. As the Beyblade comes down, E230 comes in contact with the sides of the stadium, and this contact is maintained all the way to the bottom, which theoretically allows the Combination to keep its balance despite the erratic movements of the Zero-G Stadiums. This allows it to stumble over even less, which is useful since it isn't a rare occurence in those stadiums. Beyblade: Thief Phoenic E230GCF, Samurai Saramanda E230ES A230: Armor 230 Weight: 5.5 grams The A230 Track simply adds upon the regular design of 230. Pyramidal shapes are attached to its core on four sides, with steps all around those pyramids, reminescent of the architecture of most Mesoamerican pyramids. Half of the shapes, opposite to each other, are slightly smaller than the other two. Beyblade: Pirates Killerken A230JSB, Killerken Balro A230WB F230: Free 230 Weight: grams This Track's gimmick is that it is seemingly completely free-spinning. It is implied that it can make the Chrome Wheel it is attached to rotate in the opposite direction to the one it was launched in, simply after a hit with another Beyblade of the same original spin. However, in practice this would both be impossible, and, due to the fact the Beyblade would momentarily be stationary as it changed directions, result in an automatic loss. F230's core section is larger than regular tracks such as 145 and 230 to accommodate the free-spinning mechanism, while the end of the Track bears a much larger version of the irregular structure used for the base of most Bottoms. Beyblade: Bandid Genbull F230TB, Thief Saramanda F230SF SP230: Spike 230 Weight: grams SP230 resembles a BD145 Track with the latter's protrusions made longer and necessarily facing downwards. Its disk consequently extends far along the Chrome Wheel's length, easily equalling, and it has four "claw-shaped" protrusions which are meant to control speed.
