Stone Face: Ifraid Weight: 1.2 grams This diamond-shaped Face illustrates Ifrit, a mythical creature of fire. The mark represents a simplistic demon head with small horns and some flames. Chrome Wheel: Ifraid Weight: 30.4 grams Like most Zero-G Beyblades, Ifraid's design is interrupted by a hole at one of its extremities to allow the Crystal Wheel's crystal to protrude through it. The rest of its design shows an engraved Ifrit face one one side, with two long horns reaching all the way to the other side, where a few flames are drawn into the metal, close to the hole. Crystal Wheel: Samurai Weight: 5.4 grams Full Width: 46.14 mm Height: 6.58 mm This Crystal Wheel has a general shape that tries to embrace Ifraid's own relief curves. On one side, it has a big orb known as a crystal, and it is the part that truly combines Samurai with its Chrome Wheel. To compensate with this big orb, the other side is generally bigger so an overall balance can be gained. However, Samurai can also be placed right on top of Ifraid. In its Chrome Up Mode, Samurai barely protrudes on the sides of the Ifraid Chrome Wheel, but, following this mode change, in Crystal Up Mode, it logically absorbs most if not all of the impacts and offers a completely different performance. Track: Wing 145 Weight: 2.2 grams W145 is a normal 145 Track with six sharp wings that are slightly angled. The pointy ends are however cut off to form, overall, more of a dodecagon. It is based off of W105, T125, and DF145, but the downforce it creates is actually extremely effective compared to those three Tracks, and W145 succeeds in being a top-tier Stamina Track consequently. Bottom: Circle Flat Weight: 2.5 gram Full Width: 33.80 mm Tip Width: mm Full Height: 8.86 mm Angle to real flat tip: 50° This is a Flat Bottom with a large circle around it, fixed at its base, similar to D125's own ring. The circle helps embrace the acute slope of the stadium, which is useful in such an swaying environment as the Zero-G Stadium Attack Type.
