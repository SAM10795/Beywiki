Lion Gale Force Wall Set - Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization Lion Gale Force Wall Set From Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization Lion Gale Force Wall Faceoff Set Number: BB-30A and B-101 System: Metal Fight Beyblade Contents 1 Contents 2 Overall 3 Gallery Note: This Set's release is exclusive to Hasbro. Contents BB-30A Rock Leone 145WB (Yellow highlights on Clear Wheel, yellow Track) B-101 Flame Bull 100F (Orange opaque Clear Wheel, yellow Track, white Tip) Two Ripcord Launchers (Clear yellow and red) Overall All parts in this Set are considered outclassed. 100 and 145 can both be used as mediocre substitutes in Stamina combos; however, they are easily obtained in numerous other useful releases. Bull is also benficial to Stamina types as well as Defense types, but is shrouded by other more evenly weight-distributed Clear Wheels. Rock's heavy Recoil and low weight makes it no match for modern Defense types. Flame is surpassed for Stamina purposes, while F and WB are outclassed for Attack and Defense respectively. Therefore, there is little reason to buy this Set outside of collection purposes. Gallery Retrieved from " http://wiki.worldbeyblade.org/index.php?title=Lion_Gale_Force_Wall_Set&oldid=10498"
