Attack Ring (AR): Wing Cross Weight: 5 grams Wing Cross is a strong AR because of its extremely evenly distributed weight, thin size, and smooth edges. It was previously commonly used among Zombies/Spin-Stealers before becoming outclassed by other ARs, such as Galeon's War Lion or Driger S's Tiger Defenser. Despite this, Wing Cross did not become obsolete. Bistool's Wing Cross stayed popular in the Bistool|10bBistool combo, and also in some compact combos. This AR has many uses in balance and survival type combos. Use in First Generation Zombies Wing Cross was used as an AR in first generation zombies (that is, before the S Series was released). It was used because of its balanced weight distribution, thin design, and because its projections (the attack spikes protruding from the AR) could be used to steal spin, as they extended just beyond the reach of the Wide Survivor WD. IMPORTANT: Mold Variations The mold variation of the Wing Cross AR is what makes it such a popular choice. While the Takara version of Bistool, Gekiryu-oh and Frostic Dranzer, along with the Hasbro older versions of Gekiryu-oh and Frostic Dranzer have thin spikes, the ends of Hasbro Bistool's, Frostic Dranzer's (new mold), and Gekiryu-oh's (new mold) spikes have been connected to the center of the AR, supposedly to prevent breaking. Because of this, Wing Cross's AR's new mold has become a far more popular choice than the older mold. If you wish to see combinations using Bistool's Wing Cross, please see the Bistool article.

This Beyblade is not a must-have, but it is nevertheless a welcome addition to any collection. Retrieved from " http://wiki.worldbeyblade.org/index.php?title=Frostic_Dranzer&oldid=13472"
