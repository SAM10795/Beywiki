Metal Balls - Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization Metal Balls From Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization Metal Balls are balls made of metal that can go into the base of most Draciel Beyblades. All of the Draciels except for Draciel MS has a set of Metal Balls located in the Beyblade Base. The bases that can have the metal balls added or removed are that of Draciel Metal Ball Defenser, Draciel S, and Draciel F while the bases of Draciel V, Draciel V2, and Draciel G have fixed metal balls, balls that can't be removed, inside of the base. It should also be noted that Draciel F has a free spinning metal ball in its base. Contents 1 Other Versions 1.1 Gaia Dragoon 1.2 Draciel G Other Versions Aside from the more usable metal balls that come with Draciel Metal Ball Defenser, Draciel S, and Draciel F, there are two other Beyblades that come with two different metal balls.
