Beyblade Synchrom Battle Set - Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization Beyblade Synchrom Battle Set From Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization TAKARA-TOMY released this set on June 23rd, 2012 for approximately 2100 yen. Beyblade Synchrom Battle Set Number: BBG-13 System: Beyblade Zero-G Contents 1 Content 2 Overall 3 Gallery Content Pirates Killerken A230JSB Samurai Ifraid W145CF (Clear yellow Stone Face, Track and Bottom, clear orange Crystal Wheel, red and grey Chrome Wheel stickers) Zero-G Light Launcher (Orange) Overall Pirates Killerken and Samurai Ifraid both possess great competitive parts. However, all of these interesting parts (Killerken, A230, JSB, Ifraid) are included in more worthwhile subsequent releases: the Beyblade Ultimate Synchrom DX Set Attack & Balance Type and the Beyblade Ultimate Synchrom DX Set Attack & Balance Type. At the time of this Set's release, Killerken was exclusive to it, but it then become an overall obsolete purchase due to the aforementioned Sets. Only W145 and CF, useful in Stamina and Attack respectively, are not comprised in the Ultimate Synchrom DX Sets, yet they can be obtained through more widely spread releases. Finally, the Zero-G Light Launcher provides no greater power than a regular BeyLauncher even if it offers more convenient launching angle for Zero-G Stadiums, allowing Bladers to come in contact as little as possible during launch. Generally, this Set should only be purchased for collection purposes, or to obtain a second Killerken Chrome Wheel for Synchrom with itself and conveniently get Samurai Ifraid's good parts.
