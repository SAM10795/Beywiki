Sliding Shoot - Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization Sliding Shoot From Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization The Sliding Shoot is a combination of Banking and the Catapult Shoot. Your left elbow must be bent, and when launching make sure your shooter is on an angle parallel to the Beystadium. You then push your left hand forward and your right straight back. Performing this technique will have the benefits of both Banking and the Catapult Shoot. It is also important to note that when first performing this technique, you must be positioned directly across from a wall so that your Beyblade will not bounce out of the stadium right at the beginning of the battle. When you have mastered the technique, the Beyblade should not even touch the wall. A video demonstration of this technique can be seen here, on the Beyblade Channel Retrieved from " http://wiki.worldbeyblade.org/index.php?title=Sliding_Shoot&oldid=1982"
