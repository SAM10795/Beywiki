Rock Leone 145WB - Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization Rock Leone 145WB From Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization Rock Leone 145WB Number: BB-30 System: Hybrid Wheel System Type: Defense Contents 1 Face: Leone 2 Clear Wheel: Leone 3 Metal Wheel: Rock 3.1 IMPORTANT: Mold Variation 4 Track: 145 5 Bottom: Wide Ball 5.1 Use in Defense Customization 6 Other Versions 7 Gallery 8 Overall Face: Leone The Face on this Beyblade depicts Leo, the fifth astrological sign in the zodiac. Leo is the Lion. Clear Wheel: Leone Weight: 3.0 grams The regular release of Leone is a translucent, blue-green piece. Leone is circular with small ridge details. Even with its circular shape, this Clear Wheel is too light and its weight is not distributed as well as other, top-tier Clear Wheels like Cancer, Aquario, Bull, etc. Metal Wheel: Rock Weight: 31.4 grams Rock has six large protrusions with small, shallow gaps between each one. It also overhangs the Track much like the original Leone Metal Wheel, although to a smaller extent. Rock is outclassed in every possible way however, even if it had minimal potential in Smash Attack at a certain era. Its Recoil is too important, its weight is unable to compete with most Metal Wheels, and its rounded shape is too passive to be any real threat in Attack. IMPORTANT: Mold Variation Rock has 3 different Molds: 0 Cylinders (31.4 grams), 3 Cylinders (32.6 grams), and 6 Cylinders (32.7 grams). The 0 Cylinder Mold is only available from TAKARA-TOMY products, while the 3 and 6 Cylinder Molds are available from both Takara Tomy and Hasbro products. Rock suffers from recoil, but the best way to tame this is to use a Mold with more Cylinders, as more Cylinders result in less Recoil. The 6 Cylinder Mold has the most Stamina of the three, due to the weight of the Cylinders carrying the momentum around the outside of the wheel. It is also superior to the other Molds, in terms of attack and defense. Track: 145 Weight: 1.47 grams Full Width: 20 mm Minimum Width: 18 mm Height: 14.50 mm 145, along with its variants (C145, DF145, etc.), was once the highest Track available, until the 230 Track was released with Flame Byxis. It can be used in Stamina customs to great effect due to its tall height, which allows for more wobbling as the Beyblade loses its spin velocity. However, gimmick-paired Tracks like BD145 have immensely outclassed their original bare variant, on top of several taller gimmick Tracks surpassing 145 as well against heavy, mid-height Attackers. Even in Stamina battles, 145 does not offer enough balance: Tracks like AD145 and W145 provide a good center of gravity, and aid with a slight downforce to maintain stability. Bottom: Wide Ball Weight: 0.7 gram Full Width: 15.73 mm Tip Width: 8.95 mm Full Height: 9.05 mm WB used to be widely considered the best Defense bottom when launched at 80% power with a Beylauncher. It has since been outclassed by the likes of RS, RSF, and CS. Use in Defense Customization WB was once one of the preferred choices of Bottom for Defense customizations, however, it has been outclassed in performance by RS in the top-tier customization MF-H Earth Bull GB145WB.
