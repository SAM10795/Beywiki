However the other pieces of the set have almost no use competitively and Gaia Dragoon MS and Driger MS are both very easy to find. This set is incredibly rare and nearly impossible to find, and although many of the parts are outclassed, the Tornado Balance Stadium and Dragoon MS?both of which are expensive and difficult to find?make it a highly valuable set. If you are able to find one you should definitely purchase it. Retrieved from " http://wiki.worldbeyblade.org/index.php?title=HMS_Twin_Battle_Bey_Double_Shooter_Set&oldid=7648"
