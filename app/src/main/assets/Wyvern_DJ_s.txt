It is the first mold version of Bit Protectors. Attack Ring (AR): DJ Spiker Weight: 18 grams From a design perspective, DJ Spiker is quite unique; the letters ?D? and ?J? have been integrated into the design of the AR. The ?J?'s on the Metal Frame provide most of the offense from this AR, with a small slope accompanied by three overlaid small notches that end in a blunt edge giving it Smash, Spike, and even a little Upper Attack in right-spin. Additionally, there are three plastic notches on the ?D?'s of the AR that further its Spike Attack capabilities; these are quickly flattened by regular use however. DJ Spiker has been outclassed over time by ARs such as Jiraiya MS's Jiraiya Blade, and Slash Riger MS's Slash Upper, so it has fallen out of use. Use in Smash Attack Customization DJ Spiker was once one of the best Smash Attack ARs available, but has since been outclassed. It can still be used to some degree of effectiveness however, if no better options are available. AR: DJ Spiker (Wyvern DJ) WD: Circle Wide RC: Metal Weight Grip Core (Dragoon MF) Weight Disk (WD): Circle Balance Weight: 15.13 grams Circle Balance is one of the three original HMS Weight Disks. It stands between Circle Heavy and Circle Wide, being wider and lighter than the former, but more compact and heavier than the latter. While this makes it a quite versatile Weight Disk, capable of anything, the lack of focus renders it average at everything. As a multi-purpose Weight Disk, it is outclassed by CWD Defense Ring (Sea Dragon) and should only be used if nothing else is available. Weight Disk (WD): CWD Free Saucer (Included in RBA1 Secret Green Version) Weight: 17 grams Running Core (RC): Metal Sharp Core Weight: 4 grams With its sharp metal tip, Metal Sharp Core can be considered an upgrade to Draciel MS's Sharp Core. It provides decent Survival, but was immediately outclassed by Wolborg MS's powerful Bearing Core in every way imaginable. Use in Survival Customization Metal Sharp Core may be outclassed, but it can still be used in Survival customizations. To make up for its tall height, Shining God MS's CWD God Ring is used to protect from low Upper Attackers.
