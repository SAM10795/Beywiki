BB-21 Bey Reshuffle Set Attack and Balance Type - Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization BB-21 Bey Reshuffle Set Attack and Balance Type From Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization The correct title of this article is Bey Reshuffle Set Attack & Balance Type. The substitution or omission of the & is due to technical restrictions. Bey Reshuffle Set Attack & Balance Type Number: BB-21 System: Metal Fight Beyblade Contents 1 Contents 2 Overall 3 Gallery Contents Pegasis 100HF (Black) Aquario 105F Wolf 125SF (Blue) BeyLauncher (Black) TAKARA-TOMY advertised buying the BB-22 Bey Reshuffle Set Stamina & Defense with this set. By combining the Pegasis Wheel and Beylauncher from this set with the Launcher Grip and 105F from BB-22, one could make a "Black Pegasis Set". Overall Despite being one of the older MFB products this set can still be found fairly easily. However, all of the parts in the set are outclassed. Wolf and Aquario had mediocre parts even at the time of their release, and Pegasis, though decent for a time, is now outclassed. The BeyLauncher can be easily obtained from other more useful products. There is little reason to purchase this set outside of collection purposes.
