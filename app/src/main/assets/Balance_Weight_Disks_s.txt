Chronologically, the first Balance WD to be released was Six Balance, followed by Eight Balance, and finally Ten Balance. The number before the word ?Balance? on each WD represents the number of sides on each WD (ex. Eight Balance would have eight sides, making in into an octagon shape). Note: The six sided version of the Balance WD is officially referred to as simply "Balance", but the word "Six" is commonly used before the word among Bladers to differentiate between all three types. Description The Balance WD has a weight which is between that of Wide and Heavy WDs. It's mass is distributed well, and in theory would be used for both Defense and Endurance purposes. That being said, there is numerous other options which are better for those types, and even Balance types which also in theory would benefit from this type of WD have much better choices (such as Ten Heavy). Ten Balance is the heaviest out of all of the Balance weight disks, and generally speaking, is chosen over Six and Eight Balance when customizing.
