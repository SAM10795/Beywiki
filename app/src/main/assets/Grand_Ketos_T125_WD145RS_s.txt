Grand Ketos T125/WD145RS - Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization Grand Ketos T125/WD145RS From Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization Grand Ketos T125/WD145RS Number: BB-82 System: Hybrid Wheel System Type: Defense Note: Grand Ketos was originally obtained through Random Booster Vol.5 Grand Ketos, where, instead of the conventional single "prize" Beyblade included in Random Boosters, TAKARA-TOMY included two versions. One came with T125 and a white Ketos, while the other version came with WD145 and a dark blue Ketos. Sonokong later released a starter of these Beyblades, which included a Light Launcher 2.

The dark blue Grand Cetus WD145RS was given a regular release, while the white Grand Cetus T125RS was packaged with a blue Hasbro BeyLocker. Face: Ketos The Face on this Beyblade depicts Cetus, one of the 88 constellations in space. This Face represents the Whale. Clear Wheel: Ketos Weight: 2.5 gram Full Width: 37.5 mm Minimum Width: 31.5 mm Full Height: 8.50 mm Minimum Height: 5.50 mm The Ketos Clear Wheel is perfectly symmetrical. It shows two waves flowing on each side, going in opposite directions, with white whale tails shown on both ends. Metal Wheel: Grand Weight: 29.3 gram Maximum Width: 45 mm Minimum Width: 38.5 mm Full Height: 9.50 mm Grand is an intriguing Metal Wheel; it's thicker than Earth at the thickest point on its interconnected, smooth design. However, it is not as successful defensively, as it is 3.5 grams lighter than the second mold of Earth. On the Grand Metal Wheel there are six "walls" and with every two walls there is a gap dividing them into three sections. In each section there is a wall with small textured indents; this creates some Recoil, which is never a plus for a Defense-oriented Wheel. Because of this, it does have some Smash Attack, but it is mediocre and is completely outclassed by the multitude of other great Attack-based Wheels available, such as Flash, VariAres, and Blitz. Track: T125 Weight: 1.7 gram Full Width: 24.5 mm Minimum Width: 17 mm Full Height: 12.50 mm T125 has four upward-facing wing protrusions spaced apart widely. The Track is designed to work in a similar way to DF145, although the effect it produces, like DF145, is also negligible. The performance of this Track is similar to D125, and as a height, is generally overshadowed by CH120 due to its versatility. T125 has use in Stamina customizations, and can also be used effectively in Attack customizations if CH120 is unavailable. Use in Attack Customization T125 is an excellent alternative to the 145 track in the attack combination: MF Pegasis T125R2F. T125 is also used in the Gravity Perseus Attack combination, MF Gravity Perseus T125R2F. They are both excellent Smash Attack customizations. Track: WD145 Weight: 3.6 gram Full Width: 38 mm Wing Width: 23.5 mm Wing Distance: 13.5 mm Height: 14.50 mm WD145 features three ?wings?. The wings are similar to that of ED145, the only difference being that its wings cannot spin freely. The defensive capabilities of this part are outclassed in all areas by other Defensive Tracks, such as C145, GB145, BD145, and 230, as it does not absorb hits as successfully. Furthermore, it is easy for the low attacker?s Wheel to be caught between the Wheel and WD145, causing a lot of recoil and spin reduction in the process. Bottom: Rubber Sharp Weight: 0.8 gram Full Width: 15.91 mm Tip Width: 6.87 mm Full Height: 10.96 mm Tip Height: 7.90 mm Tip Angle: 80° As its name suggests, RS is a sharp tip made of rubber, and with that, all of the problems sharp tips are known for, as well as the poor Stamina of rubber-based bottoms, and their tendency to wear down after extensive use, are brought along with it. However, RS's primary purpose is to counteract Attack customizations. The high friction of the rubber, along with the lack of movement due to the sharp tip make it incredibly difficult to move, and thus, KO. RS does seem to have difficulty sometimes outlasting left-spinning customs, but against right-spin Attack customs, despite its poor balance and Stamina, it is able to effectively neutralize them. Use in Defense Customization RS can be put to use in the top-tier combination, MF-H Basalt Kerbecs 85RS.

T125 is an interesting Track, and should be chosen over the WD145 version. The main reason for buying this Beyblade should be for RS, arguably the best Defensive Bottom currently available. Only because RS wears down after extensive use, every Blader should own multiples of this Beyblade.
