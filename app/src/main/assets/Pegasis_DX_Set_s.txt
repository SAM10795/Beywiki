Pegasis DX Set - Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization Pegasis DX Set From Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization Pegasis DX Set Number: BB-09 System: Metal Fight Beyblade Contents 1 Contents 2 Overall Contents Pegasis 105F Light Launcher BeyPointer MFB Attack Type BeyStadium Bull Metal Wheel (Blue) The Face, Track and Bottom in this set are clear versions. Overall The Pegasis DX Set was the very first MFB set released. As a result, it is now very difficult to find at a reasonable price, although the Sonokong release of the same set is slightly easier to find. Its rarity is increased further due to the inclusion of the BeyPointer, a popular collector item. The only competitively useful part in the Pegasis DX Set is the MFB Attack Type BeyStadium, which can be found in other more common and useful sets. Pegasis and Bull are heavily outclassed, and the BeyLauncher is generally preferred over the Light Launcher. This, combined with the rarity of the set, means there is little reason to purchase this set outside of collection purposes.
