Circle Balance - Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization Circle Balance From Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization Weight: 15.13 grams Circle Balance is one of the three original HMS Weight Disks. It stands between Circle Heavy and Circle Wide, being wider and lighter than the former, but more compact and heavier than the latter. While this makes it a quite versatile Weight Disk, capable of anything, the lack of focus renders it average at everything. As a multi-purpose Weight Disk, it is outclassed by CWD Defense Ring (Sea Dragon) and should only be used if nothing else is available.
