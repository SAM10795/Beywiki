Useless even at the time of its release, this part is outclassed and does not warrant usage in any circumstance. It should not even be considered for usage. Beyblades with this part Ultimate Dragoon Megaro Arm Makendo Bakushin-Oh Bound Attacker Roller Attacker Sparkling Attacker Overall The Flat BB as a part of the original 4-Layer Series does not have the capability to swap SGs. This severely handicaps the part and negates any potential usage. There is absolutely no reason for any Blader to desire to obtain this part outside of collection purposes.
