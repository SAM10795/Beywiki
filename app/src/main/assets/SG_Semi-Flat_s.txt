It is sharp but flattened on the very end. The movement pattern exhibited when launched straight into a BeyStadium is best suited for Endurance purposes. However, when launched on a slant it begins to move in a circular attack-type pattern. Seeing as a flat tip would sacrifice all of its Survival ability while a sharp tip would sacrifice its Defense ability. Being a mixture of both allows it to have very good Balance giving it quite alot of popularity in Compact customization.
