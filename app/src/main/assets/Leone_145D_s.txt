Leone 145D - Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization Leone 145D From Beywiki, the Beyblade Encyclopedia - Presented by the World Beyblade Organization Leone 145D (Defense) Number: BB-04 System: Metal System Type: Defense Note: This article was written near the release of Metal Fight Beyblade and must be updated. Please do not take all of the information here as the truth, as they had not been tested as extensively then as they have been now, and the uses of their parts have changed since their original release. Updates will be posted on the main page when completed. Contents 1 Face: Leone 2 Wheel: Leone 3 Track: 145 4 Bottom: Defense 4.1 Use in Stamina customization 5 Other Versions 6 Gallery 7 Overall Leone is one of the first four Metal Fight Beyblade's released, and it is part of the Horoscope Series along with Pegasis, Bull, and Sagittario. Face: Leone The face on this Beyblade depicts Leo, which is a sign in the Zodiac. Wheel: Leone Weight: 38 grams Maximum Outer Diameter: 43.57 Millimeters Maximum Height: 8.97 Millimeters The Leone Wheel has six protrusions, each separated by v-shaped gaps, resembling the paws of a lion. Three of the protrusions have a purple marking on them, with the paws sloping slightly down and curving outwards. The rest of the three protrusions have the paws sloped outwards and downwards, with no paint marks. Leone's Wheel has been designed to be very compact although due to the high recoil of this wheel it has been outclassed for defensive purposes by Earth, Libra and even Rock. Its aggressive design better lends itself to Attack customizations, such as MF Leone H145RF, MF Leone R145RF, or Leone 100RF. Track: 145 Weight: 1.47 grams Full Width: 20 mm Minimum Width: 18 mm Height: 14.50 mm 145, along with its variants (C145, DF145, etc.), was once the highest Track available, until the 230 Track was released with Flame Byxis. It can be used in Stamina customs to great effect due to its tall height, which allows for more wobbling as the Beyblade loses its spin velocity. However, gimmick-paired Tracks like BD145 have immensely outclassed their original bare variant, on top of several taller gimmick Tracks surpassing 145 as well against heavy, mid-height Attackers. Even in Stamina battles, 145 does not offer enough balance: Tracks like AD145 and W145 provide a good center of gravity, and aid with a slight downforce to maintain stability. Bottom: Defense Weight: 0.68 gram Full Width: 15.55 mm Tip Width: 8.94 mm Full Height: 8.89 mm Tip Height: 7.59 mm Tip Angle: 35° This is a Defense Bottom, which acts as a wider version of a Sharp tip. When hit by an opponent, a Beyblade with this Bottom will have lessened recoil and will recover from attacks more efficiently than a Sharp Tip. However, while recovering, the Defense Bottom will cause the Beyblade to lose some stamina, caused by the added friction. Use in Stamina customization D can be put to use in the combination Duo/Phantom Aquario/Cancer.Cygnus TH170D. D is a superior choice for TH170 because it retains balance better than WD.
