Hybrid Wheel Reshuffle Set (Attack & Balance) Number: BB-56 System: Metal Fight Beyblade TAKARA-TOMY released this set on November 21, 2009, for approximately 2625 yen. Contents 1 Contents 2 Overall 3 Gallery Contents Killer Gemios DF145FS Storm Aquario M145Q (Orange Aquario, clear purple Track and Bottom) Dark Capricorne 105RF (Purple Capricorne, clear Track and Bottom) BeyLauncher (Yellow) Overall While this set has interesting parts like recolours, they are almost all thoroughly outclassed. The only competitively viable parts are RF and Aquario, which are top-tier for Attack and Defense, respectively. The BeyLauncher is the most powerful launcher in MFB, and it is preferred by most people. However, you can get RF, Aquario and the BeyLauncher in more competitive sets, such as the Big Bang Pegasis DX Set (except for Aquario), or even on their own. Overall, there is no reason to purchase this Set outside of collection purposes.
